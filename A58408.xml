            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> How to make the Works about a Houſe Regular.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Firſt and a Second part I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that I might diſcuſs things in their order: for a Houſe muſt be built before it be furniſhed. Theſe who inclines not to read this may ſtep foreward to the Second; perhaps there they will find Satisfaction, albeit others may be as deſirous of this, who have any works to make.</p>
                     <p>My deſigne by contrivance, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the conſequence of Inadvertancy, or the abrupt procedure in Incloſing and Planting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Here in the entrance you may take a view of a Houſe which I have Invented (See Fig. 1.) it is but little, yet very commodious &amp; Cheap. There is only 4 Rooms on a Floor (you may have Cloſets within the wall, although not here demonſtrated) all which enter off the Stayr (yet comunication betwixt) and the door is in the midle, &amp; there is 10 ſteps up the firſt Story, (which is hall or dining Room, withdrawing Room, Bed-Chamber and Waiting-Room) and 10 Steps down to the lower Story, which is half under ground, and vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this is Kitchen, Cellers and Ladners, &amp;c. That above the dining Room ſtory may be Bed-Chambers, library and with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Room: and above theſe garrets for wardops. The Roof may be in three ſo as the midle part may be flat and covered with lead and the two ſides more ſteep &amp; flated: there is alſo a Stayr coming down
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53203:8"/>from the hall without to the parterre of graſs and gravel, on whoſe corners ar two Pavilions opening without the line of the Houſe and ſets off in place of Iammes; one of which may be a Store-houſe, and the other a Dove-houſe: the Stables, Baking and Brewing houſe ar on the oppoſite ſide, moſt conveniently placed, as hereafter I ſhall demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Situate your Houſe in a healthy Soyl, near to a freſh-ſpring, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the Impetuous-weſtwinds, northern colds and eaſtern blaſts: and mind regularity, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Make all the Buildings and Plantings ly ſo about the Houſe, as that the Houſe may be the Centre; all the Walks, Trees and Hedges running to the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>As the Sun is the Centre of this World: as the Heart of the man is the Centre of the man: as the noſe the Centre of the face: and as it is unſeemly to ſee a man wanting a leg, ane arme &amp;c. or his noſe ſtanding at one ſide the face, or not ſtreight, or wanting a cheek, ane eye, ane eare, or with one (or all of them) great at one ſide and ſmall on the other; Juſt ſo with the Houſe-courts, Avenues, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orchards, &amp;c. where regularity or uniformity is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Therefore whatever you have on the one hand, make as much, and of the ſame forme and in the ſame place, on the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if you would work right, beginne orderly, that is, find the central line by erecting a perpendicular on the midle of the Houſe-front, to extend as farr both back and fore as requiſite: hence you may draw parallels, Meaſure and Stake out your Avenues, Gardens, &amp;c. as you pleaſe: ever minding to Meaſure alike at both ſides of the Central line; How to find this Central line and to ſet off paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels is taught in Chap: 3: Sect: 1. and 2.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet for further Illuſtration take ane example by a draught of my own inventing (ſee fig: 2.) which if rightly underſtood may be applyed diverſly and Improven elegantly.</p>
                     <p>It is here in a ſmall Scale. the Houſe is in the Centre, and at B, round by the Houſe is Baleſters, the Common Avenue is by N,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53203:8"/>and ends in a triangle, <hi>c,</hi> is the outer Court, and in the two tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular Courts marked with O, ar placed the office-houſe moſt notably (with their back part to the Court <hi>c,</hi>) opening without the line of the Houſe: So diſmounting at the gate of the Court (through which you may walk on foot to the Houſe) let the Horſes be taken about to the Stables by the Way the ending of the Avenuo leads. The two plots P, may be Pondes, the two with G, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Gardens: a proper place alſo for gooſberries, Currans, and Straberries. On the ſouth ſide the Houſe there is the pleaſure or Flower-Garden called the <hi>Parterre,</hi> at the two ſydes thereof Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen-Gardens marked with K, then another Walk ending in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle at S, Leading out to the Lawn or deer Park. The viſtaes or walks of view that runs from the 4 Angles of the Houſe ar very pleaſant and convenient, and ar good Shelter; for which cauſe there ar two Thickets on the north ſide marked with <hi>t,</hi> on the ſouth ſide are two ſuch marked <hi>a,</hi> for Nurſeries, and at E, and W, ar two Orchards. The whole is environed with two rowes of Forreſt Trees without the wall: And if the paper were large I would ſhew you that the Park Wall ſhould be parallel to theſe, that is, every where equidiſtant from the Houſe its Centre at leaſt, the whole an <hi>octagone</hi> near to a regular <hi>polygon</hi> conſiſting of equal ſides &amp; Angles. The walks with their fences (being run foreward from all the 4 ſides and 4 Angles of the Houſe till they touch at the midle of each ſide of the Park Wall,) ſerves in the Park for diviſors: which diviſors may be howthorn Hedges, and theſe in the Gardens holly, except the Court in the entrie and office-houſe Courts, me thinks walls are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite there. Alſo there ſhould be ane aſcent to the Houſe, (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) as at the firſt Court gate 2 ſteps, at the 2d 4 ſteps. &amp;c. But Leaving it to let every man apply as his ground and ability will beſt admit, I come to ſpeake of regularity, where confined.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But as to work or make regularity among confirments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Ingenuity; ſo is there difficulty in teaching the ſame, becauſe of the great variety of places: and being that I know not how to give precepts for it (except what is ſaid above of the Centre and Central
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53203:9"/>line) therefore I ſhall only inſtance in by example.</p>
                     <p>As where I was confined, to add what I will, but to diminiſh non. I viewed the works, and found ſeveral regular and Irregular things don on the one ſide the Houſe, and nothing on the other anſwerable: therefore I Staked out the ſame on the other; ſtill where I found an Irregular piece on the one ſide, I ſtaked out the very ſame on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and thus two Irregularities produced one uniformity.</p>
                     <p>Or where there had been much wrought for ane Avenue, but did not Front the Houſe right, by reaſon of a precipice on the weſt hand. I got on the houſe top, viewed the ground immediatly, ſaw that I might turn my face towards the Eaſt and get ſtately Avenues with Gardens on each hand at pleaſure, and the ſaid precipice turned at my back.</p>
                     <p>But to draw any place firſt on Paper, as they ſtand, we ſee faults plainly, and how to help them accordingly: Therefore to aſſiſt you further in making your works orderly I ſhall ſhew you in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chap.</p>

                     <p>All draughts not drawn by the Scale at but ſuppoſitions, the Scale makes them ſtand directly on Paper as on ground, or would ſtand, if put upon it: therefore of ſingular uſe in contriving, you ſhould have ane eye to the conſequence of all your undertakings, leſt you run Inadvertantly into a ſnare: for when you have determined or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the contrivance, perhaps hath gone a great length in working the ſame, yet as you proceed (one thing making way for another) you may come to ſee a farr better way, and ſo to overturne moſt or all that is done, to get your new and better way accompliſhed; which oblidges you either to double pains &amp; Charges, or otherwiſe, in ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, to fit ſtill with a diſſatiſfied mind; all which may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and timely prevented by drawing &amp; projecting on paper, as is ſaid.</p>

You may make as many Scales as you think will be needful, inſomuch that when you have a draught at any time to draw, you have no more to do, but by Arithmetick find which of them Scales you muſt draw it by. Therefore make a Thinn broad rule 2 foot long Pear or Aple tree, Red of Plumtree, Planetree, Boxwood, or Braſs which is beſt: put as many on bothſides as it will contain. I make moſt uſe of a Diagonal Scale, (ſee fig. 3.) its done by dividing the Inch into ſo many equal parts, as 8 in the Inch, 30 in the Inch, 100 or 200 in the Inch, the figure and Multiplication will informe you for 5 diviſions, drawn the length of the Rule and 7 in the Inch; the other way is a Scale of 35 in the Inch, 5 times 7 is 35 and ſo furth. If your Rule be 2 foot, there may be 2 Lengthes on it, or as your lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Compaſs may conveniently reach. You may alſo make ſome of the common Scales, that is, divide the Inch the ordinary way in a ſtraight line into ſo many equal, parts (ſee fig. 4.) ſeeing the Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals hath only ſuch as Multiplication produceth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you be to draw a draught, but knows not how to take your meaſures from the Scale, then if you know the meaſures on ground take ſo many diviſions (off the Scale with your Compaſs) as you had feet, ells, or falls (whatever you meaſure by) and ſet on the Paper: example, if you were to draw an orchard whoſe lenth is 680 ells by a Scale of 200 in the Inch (as the upper end of <hi>fig.</hi> 3.) you are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many times 200 is in 680, that ſo many whole Inches you may take on your Compaſs, and the odds or fraction you may get therewith from the ſubdivided Inch: here if you ſet one foot of the Compaſs at 6 and reach the other to <hi>a,</hi> which 6 half Inches is 600, and 8 diviſions foreward on the ſubdivided half Inch is 80; the ſame you may place on the Paper &amp; draw accordingly. Example 2. by the other Scale of 100 in the Inch, if you would ſet the breadth of 23 foot-walk on Paper, here it is not one Inch, therefore you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> take but ſuch a part of one Inch, <hi>viz.</hi> Set the Compaſs from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> on the Compaſs; therefore do as before. You may perceive that the 23 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions on the Rule is the 3 from 20 foreward on the line betwixt 20
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53203:10"/>and 30 where the <hi>o</hi> is placed to make it plain. If your draught be ſo large that your Compaſs cannot reach its length, then you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſame by 2 , 3, or 4, &amp;c. and take the product on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and ſet alongſt ſo many times as was your diviſor. This is ſo plain that it needs no exemple.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if you have a draught to draw on one or many ſheets of Paper, and you deſire to draw it as large as the Paper will bear, not to go off; Then take the length of your Paper in Inches, by which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the length of your ground whether feet, ells, &amp;c. and the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhall be the Scale you muſt draw it by; that is, an inche divided into ſo many equal parts. Example, if you have a plot 360 foot in length to draw on a ſheet common Paper 16 Inches: but to make it, keep a little within the Paper, at each end call it 15 inches; ſo 360 the length of the ground divided by 15 the length of the Paper gives 24: therefore take a Scale of 24 in the inche, and draw it by the ſame. Example 2. the breadth of a field 864 Falls, I deſire to draw it on the ⅛ of a ſheet <hi>viz.</hi> 3 Inches. Divide 864 by 3, it gives 2.88, but this being too ſmall, I take the ½ thereof <hi>viz.</hi> 144 and drawes it by the ſame, mynding that each diviſion on my Paper is 2 Falls on ground.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Or if you had a draught, and knowes not what Scale it was drawen by, if you know what ground it contains, the work is firſt, to meaſure it by a ſuppoſed Scale, and ſecondly to find a mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional betwixt the true quantity of Acres and that quantity found by the ſuppoſed Scale. And thirdly by the golden Rule ſay, as the quantity of Acres found by the ſuppoſed Scale is to the mean proportional: ſo is the ſuppoſed ſcale to the true Scale. Example, if you have a plot or field of ground containing 72 Acres, and you meaſure it by a Scale of 18 Falls in the inche, and that makes but 40 ½ Acres, the queſtion is what Scale was it drawn by? You will find the mean proportional betwixt 40.5. and 72 to be 54 (as in chap. 8. ſect. 6.) and as 40.5. is to 54: ſo is 18 to 24. Thus it appears that the ſaid plot was drawen by a Scale of 24 Falls in the inche.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53203:10"/>
                     <p>Example 2. If you have a plot (containing 14 Acres 64 falls, and meaſuring it by a Scale of 40 in the inche makes 90 Acres, what Scale was it drawen by? You will find (as is ſaid) the mean betwixt 14.4. and 90 to be 36: therefore as 90 the Acres found by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Scale, is to 36 the mean proportional: ſo is 40 the ſuppoſed Scale to 16 the true Scale. This tells that it was drawen by a Scale of 16 in the Inche.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But if you have a draught, and knowes not what Scale it was drawn by nor what ground it containes, ſo as thereby you might find its Scale, &amp; you deſire to diminiſh or Enlarge the ſame on Paper, and yet that it may bear the ſame ſhape and proportion in every reſpect.</p>
                     <p>You may divide or multiply every particular line or part of it: as if you would have it ⅓ leſs, then divide each part by 3, and take one of theſe and ſet on the Paper. Or if you would have it twice as large, then double every part and portion of it, that is, take the double of each length and breadth on the Compaſs and ſet on the Paper and draw accordingly.</p>
                     <p>But if your draught be a Taliduce, Mapps, or the like, draw a ſquair by the outter edg thereof, and divide each ſide into ſo many equal parts, as you think fit, betwixt which draw parallel lines all through croſſing from oppoſite ſides, and notice what part of your draught falls within the precinct of each little ſquair, &amp; ſo Copy it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper whether larger or leſſer, as if you would have it one fifth leſs, take one fifth of the ſide of one of the little ſquairs, and therewith Lottrie or ſquare your clean Paper. And likewayes take one fifth of length and breadth of each particular within each little ſquair, and the one fifth diſtance that ſuch and ſuch parts, creeks and angles are diſtant from any two of the angles of the ſame; and ſo place them accordingly in the leſſer little ſquairs of your clean Paper.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When you deſigne to ſurvey any plot of ground be careful in meaſuring the diſtances truly, and keep exact accompt thereof. You may make firſt a ſuppoſed figure on a Paper before you begin, that thereon you may write your meaſures, as you go along: as if it be a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53203:11"/>Hexagon, (<hi>ſee fig.</hi> 27.) draw a figure at random containing 6 ſides, and having obſerved the meridian on the ground (which you may either find by the Compaſs or let the central line of the Houſe its perpendiculars or parallels ſerve in lieu thereof) mark down ſuch on your ſuppoſed figure: then let the two men with the chain begin at any angle; the foremoſt may have 10 ſmall ſticks to thruſt in at every length of the chain, &amp; let the hindermoſt man gather them up as he comes along; and when all up, give them to his aſſiſtant to begin again, as before, calling that, one change (ſtill being carefull to go ſtraight betwixt the two ends or extreams) and when yon come at the other end, compt how many changes, chaines, and links, as if the hedg <hi>c. d.</hi> be 70 Falls, write that down as in the figure, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the reſt obſerving the ſame methode.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But albeit you meaſure round any plot or Field, yet you muſt know how to find the quantity of the angles, and protract the ſame: therefore I ſhall ſhew you the moſt exact of all others and mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Example by <hi>fig.</hi> 21.

Turn about the Index till it poynt to A. notice what degrees it cutts, as ſupoſe 80. and write down: here you have the ſide B. C. 384. the angle A. B. C. 60. and the angle B. C. A. 80. (and by conſequence the Angle B. A. C. 40. being its the complement to 180.) therefore go to your paper and draw a given line as A.

                     <p>ALL walkes ſhould front the gates or entries, whether they lead to a houſe, Garden, Gate, Door, Park, Wood, or highway. When you have determined on the end of the walk as the door of the houſe, in the midle thereof on the line of the Houſe-front ſet off a perpendicular, to find the central line as aforeſaid, ſee Chap. 1. Sect. 4. and for your more exact performance thereof prepare this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> take two ſtraight Rules about 3 or 4 foot long, joyn them Croſswayes in other, ſo that the 4 Angles where they cutt may be exact ſquairs; then at each end of theſe, joyn a piece Rule ſtanding up about 4 or 5 Inches, and in the exact midle of each of theſe pieces make a ſlit up and down, and in the midle of theſe ſlits a piece ſmall ſilk threed; theſe being ſtraight and perpend: up are excellent to view by. Place this croſs on the head of the three footed Staff, hing a Plumb whereby you may plant it Horizontale upon occaſion: on this you may alſo place your protector with the box and needle, when you go to ſurveying, for every one has not a plane Table.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53203:12"/>
                     <p>As to the Avenue, ſet one ſide of your croſs parallel to the given line (the Houſe-wall) this you may do with moſt eaſe, by taking one end thereof within the door till the ſide touch the door cheeks, and you may alſo view croſs by the ſide-wall backſight and foreſight, till it ſtand exactly Parellel thereto: then turne, and ſtanding within the door, view ſtraight out by the ſilk threeds, and ſo direct one to drive ſtakes all along ſo farr as you can ſee, in a ſtraight and perpend: line. You may alſo find this perpendicular central line, thô Walls, Hedges, Houſes, Trees &amp;c. obſtruct, if you can ſee over them out at any Window or off the Battlement if there be any, otherwayes recurre to the Rules in Sect. 3. and 4.</p>
                     <p>And as by this Inſtrument you may raiſe any perpendicular, ſo by the ſame you may let perpend fall: for you may alter it hither and thither upon the given line, till it direct to the angle or point aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The mid or central line of your Avenue being found out you muſt place your croſs thereon, and thereby ſet off the half breadth thereof at each ſide: do this at both ends and midle, that they be exactly Parallel; and therein drive ſtakes almoſt to the head. And when you come to marke out for the Trees, or to plant them, ſet a ſtraight pole at each driven ſtake, for your direction in going ſtraight betwixt the ſame.</p>
                     <p>If the length of the walke be confin'd, divide it by the diſtance you mynd to plant at; and if there be any odd, add or ſubſtract till all the diſtances be equal: which diſtance you muſt take on a chain (for a line will reach and ſhrink) and begin at one end, and go ſtraight to the other, thruſting in a ſmall ſtake at each length; minding to let both rowes go on ſquair together, that is, one on each ſide and viewing will find the other two, if there be ſower rowes, ſee the Avenues fig. 2.</p>
                     <p>And though the ground be unevenly, yet you muſt hold the chain level: wherefore you may have a ſquair &amp; Plumb fixed at your pole or ſtaff for your more exact performance thereof.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53203:13"/>
                     <p>When you have ſtaked out the ground, prepare the rounding ſtring <hi>viz.</hi> a piece line doubled and tyed near the point of a ſtick, and ſo put the double on the ſtakes where the Trees muſt ſtand, and ſtreatching the ſame, make a ſcratch with the point of the ſtick round; and with a ſpade follow that Compaſs and make the hole. See the ſecond part of this Treatiſe, where there be directions how to prepare the ground and plant.</p>
                     <p>If you obſerve what is ſaid, you may ſtake out any kind of walk, having one line found; wherefore I ſhall ſhew you how to find out one line whatever obſtruct.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As firſt, ſuppoſe you would run a line or walke through a wood: when you have concluded on the end thereof, there erect a perpendicular as above, and run it as farr into the wood as you can; then at each ſide thereof ſet off a Parallel line two or three foot from the central line, or half the breadth of the intended walk: ſo ſhall you have three Parallel lines running on in ſtraight lines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And where any one runns on a tree, run foreward the other two, and ſet it off again (when paſt the Tree) as it was Parallel to its fellowes, and ſo proceed till you be through the wood, or thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, ſtill marking the Trees that falls in the intervall to be cut.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond way is by means of Lanthornes with burning Candles, in a calm night when dark hanged on ſtakes, you ſtanding in the wood may plant ſtakes at pleaſure, let the Candles furtheſt from you be higheſt, and remove foreward the lights as need requires.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if both ends of your walk be determined, and you cannot ſee betwixt, by reaſon of Lengthes, Hills, Woods, Houſes, or ſome ſuch obſtruction, in ſuch a caſe let two having each a pole go to the midle or to ſuch a place betwixt where they may (by looking backſight and foreſight) perceive the two extreams, (where ſhould be a pole with white Paper on the ſlip boards to make the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) turn your faces towards other, ſtanding at a large diſtance aſunder, but ſo as you may both ſee your reſpective objects. And let A direct B to ſet the pole in line with his and that at the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and B direct A to hold in line with his and that at the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53203:13"/>ſo each directing other by words or Signes; let both alter to and fro, till they have their deſires at once; then ſhall theſe two and the extreams be all four in a ſtraight line, whereby you may ſet as many as you pleaſe. This way I found out by experiment, and thinks it worthy a place amongſt the Mathematicks.</p>
                     <p>But if you cannot ſee the two ends, when ſtanding in the midle; although the Poles be never ſo high, then if it be Wood or Hedges, the foreſaid Lanthrons and Candles will do the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But if the obſtructions be Hills, Walls, or Houſes, for which you cannot ſee, ſtanding in the midle, as a-foreſaid, neither by Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throns, nor yet by high Poles; then do by Parallels thus: ſet off a parallel line ſo farr, as that it may run quyt beyond the obſtruction, (on the ſide moſt convenient) then ſet in the parallel again at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places; ſo ſhall both agree, and as will appear when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is removed.</p>
                     <p>But if none of theſe will do, run a line over by gueſs, and if it miſs (as no wonder) take notice of your Errour at the end, by letting a perpendicular fall on the determined poynt (by means of the ſquair or croſs) and the meaſure betwixt finds out the Errour: then meaſure the length of your intended walk or line, aforeſaid; and at the quarter thereof, ſet off the ¼ of your Errour: At the midle the ½ and at the ¾ of the length, ſet off the ¾ of your Errour; this will lead you ſtraight upon your purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Trigonometry will alſo ſolve this, if you could work exactly: for here you have two ſides and one angle; ſee the laſt Chap. Sect. 9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And if you have a given line and deſires to ſet of a Parallel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, but cannot meaſure off at both ends as is needfull, there being, Trees, Waters, Hills, Walls or Houſes, obſtructing, you may meaſure, ſquair or Perpendicular off at any part of the given line (that is moſt convenient) ſo far as you mind to go with your parallel; at, or upon which point erect another Perpendicular to run back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53203:14"/>and foreſight; the which ſhall be exactly parallel to the given line, as was required.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Having given ſome directions for ſtaking out walks for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet your Avenues and Walks muſt end in ſome figure or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether Triangular, Circular, Ovall, &amp;c. For Coaches and Carts to turn in, as alſo where Walks meets, or Croſs other, its requiſite that there be ſome figure for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>How Avenues may end in Semicircles and Triangles, ſee fig: 2. and if it end in a Semicircle, it may begin with the ſame or rather (if the ground will ſuffer) it ſhould begin with a whole circle having ſower oppoſite opens the breadth of the walk: If it end with a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, it may begin ſo likwayes, but rather with a ſquait (the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings Integer) whoſe entries or opens muſt be in its Angles. And alſo where the Walkes meets or Croſs, I have a little figure or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ſee fig: 2. And yet the Trees in the whole draught every way lineal, except in the ſegment of a Circle, where they deviat a little. The figures ſhould be at leaſt three times the breadth of the walk, but ſo as the ground will admit; let not the Trees in the figure ſtand much above half the diſtance of theſe in the walke, but divide equally make the breadth of the walk in proportion to its length: I think an Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a mile in length may be 40 ells in breadth, ſee Chap: 5. ſect: 2. neither ſhort Broad nor long narrow walkes are handſome, except in caſe of walkes of Shade, &amp; alſo of Avenues where the Front of the houſe, Jammes, courts, or pavilions ar to be obſerved: for the breadth of the court ſhould be at leaſt the whole length of the Houſe-front; &amp; if two Jammes the midle walke of the Avenue may be the breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, and the ſide-walkes the breadth of the Jammes; or the mid walk the breadth of the whole Front, &amp; the ſide walkes the breadth of the pavilions, which ar on the corners of the Court; or divide the Houſe Front in three, making the midle walke the juſt breadth of both the ſide ones: ſo ſhall they be every way lineall, but do not mask a fine Front nor veyle a pleaſant proſpect. The length of the Avenue, it ſhould run ſo farr as (when we ſtand at the houſe) we may loſe ſight of the farr end, if poſſible. When it runs over a Brae, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53203:14"/>to the eye it appears <hi>Infinitum,</hi> and where that cannot be had, it doth very well where the ſight terminates in a grove or circle of Firrs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The diſtance of Trees is ſometimes according to the quality of the ground, or Trees to be planted, ſomtimes to the number of Rowes, or as the figure to be planted will beſt admit. If a good Soyl, plant at the wider diſtance; if 4 Rowes, as an Avenue, Plant at 5.6.7. or 8 ells diſtance; if 2 ſingle rowes at 4.5. or 6 ells; if circular figures or the like at 2, 3 or 4 ells, or as the figure is in ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or greatneſs, and Plant ſo as they may ſhew the figure well.</p>
                     <p>Some Trees requires wider diſtance than others, theſe that grow greateſt, by conſequence muſt have the largeſt diſrance, ſee the next Chap: ſect: 10.</p>
                     <p>Note, that you Intermix not great Trees and ſmall Trees in Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, neither quick-growers and flow-growers: for I obſerve a kind of Emulation amongſt them.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> How to Plant Thickets and Orchards.</head>
                     <p>AS the ground where you Plant muſt be Incloſed, ſo muſt the Trees ſtand ſome diſtance off the fence: if it be a wall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ar Wall-Trees, let the ſtandards be at leaſt one of their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from the ſame, &amp; if you deſigne fine walks round by the wall, Plant the Row next thereunto with Dwarff-Trees or ſome low Hedge, and the Trees half a diſtance off ſuch; if the incloſure be a Hedge. obſerve the ſame Rule. Alſo let the Trees be Parallel to the Incloſure: but every Plot will not ſuffer to be Planted every way lineal and ſtand Parallel to the Incloſure too; therefore it will be neceſſary firſt to Inquire a little what figures they be that may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53203:15"/>thus be Planted, (a thing I never ſaw Inquired) And ſecondly how to plant thoſe that will not admit of this order, and laſtly how to plant the ſeveral wayes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The figures that may be planted every way in row ar many, yet for Brevities ſake I ſhall mention but ſome as oblong, &amp; geometrical ſquairs (ſee fig: 5.6.7.8.9.) Rhombus (ſee fig: 10.) Rhomboïdes (ſee fig. 11.) Oxigone or Equilateral Triangle (ſee fig: 12.) Orthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone or right Angled Triangle (ſee fig: 13.) Ambligone or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle with one obtuſe and two Acute Angles, (ſee fig: 14.) a ſort of Trapezia, (ſee fig: 15.) Hexagone, (ſee fig: 16.) Octagone (as the whole fig: 2.) theſe regular Polygones ar the neareſt way for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Circle.</p>
                     <p>Many more figures there be both Regular and Irregular that will admit of this order, but theſe may ſuffice for Illuſtration. As for theſe that will not, you may Plant them Parallel, to as many ſides as you can, and let the reſt, fall as they will.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now as to the ſeveral wayes ſo farr as I know, there is but three principal wayes of Planting, every way lineal (although there be more built thereon) <hi>viz.</hi> Squair, Rhombus, and Triangle: In the firſt, three of them makes a right Triangle, and ſower of them diſcribes a Circle; (ſee Fig: 5.) In the ſecond, three of them makes a triacute Triangle, and ſower of them diſcribes an Elipſis (ſee fig: 6.) note, that this way will admit of Variation. In the third, three of them makes an equilateral Triangle, and ſower of them diſcribes an Ovall, (See Fig: 7.) And ſeven of them makes a Circle with a Centre, See Fig: 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The manner of Planting the firſt, which is the common way is exemplified in Fig: 5. take the length of one ſide, and divide by the diſtance you mind to plant at, and the product tells how many, and whats over, if there be any, you may proportion as before. Then with your determined diſtance on a chain, begin at a Corner and go round the out-line exactly, where the outter row muſt ſtand, thruſting in a ſtake at every length; theſe being in ſtraight line and at equall diſtances, alſo ſtraight bodyed and perpendicular up. The way is thus: One muſt ſtand at W. and view to E. another at S.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53203:15"/>and view to N. Cauſing a thrid ſet a Stake in line with both as at L. So removing from Stake to Stake (viewing ſtill to the oppoſite) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the thrid by words or ſignes till his Stake be in line with both: thus proceed till all the plot be Staked out. See Fig. 5. The way the Trees will ſtand when Planted.</p>
                     <p>But if the ground be unevenly, cauſe the Stake-ſetter, hold up a long and ſtraight pole (with a plumb Rule for holding it perpend:) and when he removes, to thruſt a ſtake exactly where the pole ſtood: but if the pole will not do, let the viewers mount them on three foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſtanding leathers; and if that will not do, betake to the Rule, mentioned in the laſt Chap, for taking a line over a Hill, where both ends ar confined, as I have done, in the like caſe.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſome ſcarcely knowes ſignes, the Stake-ſetter muſt be told that when the viewer ſtands his face northwards and waves the right hand Eaſtward, that he muſt go a little caſt with his Pole, and when he waves the left, then weſtwards, when both his hands at once eaſt or weſt, then he muſt hold the head of the Pole (if he have no plumb for his direction in this) but when the viewer moves both Hands , or Hat, up and down, then the Stake-ſetter muſt fix there.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If you Plant the ſecond way in a ſquair, the out-line round is not equal diſtances thô the oppoſites ſide are, here in this example one ſide is about 12 and one half ells diſtance, and the other 15. and the viewing being Angular, and not from oppoſite ſides makes the Trees ſtand about 10 and one half ells.</p>
                     <p>But if you will Plant Rombuſoical, as is deſigned, then its don by the equal diviſion of its fower ſides, and by viewing to its oppoſits, as the Rombus A. B. C. D. Within Fig: 6. Doth repreſent; for though its Angles be not ſquair nor equal, yet its ſides muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and Angles oppoſite: and here it may be varyed, as is ſaid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſhape of the ground, by ſtreatching longer or opening it wider. A. C. is its breadth and D. B. its length. Or you may alſo plant by the Romboides, as I have done, D. A. E. F. &amp; conſequently many more figures may be planted thereby as well as theſe may be,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53203:16"/>varyed or altered, and yet all continue in this <hi>Cyrus</hi> order.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the 3d way take an example in Fig: 7. where the length of one ſide muſt be divided by the determined diſtance <hi>viz.</hi> the diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce off the fence being ſubſtracted, the length of the ſide A. B. is 119 and I deſigne to plant at 8 and ane half ells: therefore I divide 119 by 8.5. decimally, the product is 14 diſtances; then there will be 15 rowes; here one ſide is Staked out, whereby you may Plant the whole plot thus: take two diſtances on the chain, that is, hold one end exactly at A. And the other at C. Again with that meaſure on the Chain, hold one end at the firſt Stake (<hi>viz:</hi> A.) And the other at the ſecond (<hi>viz:</hi> L.) cauſe a thrid take the chain by the exact midle, and (holding it ſtiff) thruſt in a ſtraight ſtake at the Angle of the Chain (<hi>viz :</hi> N.) ſo thoſe three makes an equilateral Triangle; then remove, holding one end at the ſecond Stake (<hi>viz:</hi> L.) And the other at the thrid <hi>viz.</hi> C. Streatch the Chain and thruſt in a Stake at its Angle or midle as before. Thus you may proceed from Stake to Stake till that row be Planted: and ſo on from row to Row till the whole Plot be Staked out, minding to ſet the Stakes ſtraight and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, conſidering their thickneſs alſo; in all which if you be not very exact, ye cannot avoyd error before you come at the other ſide. Therefore I ſhall ſhew you another way of my own Inventing, which is more ſure and exact &amp; leſs paines, <hi>viz:</hi> Let firſt that one ſide be marked out, as before, and having ſet two or three Stakes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond row, as is juſt now taught; then upon two, hold to the Chain, and Plant another Stake to begin a thrid row; (as at D.) then take the exact diſtance betwixt L. and D. On the Chain, and therewith Stake out the ſide B. R. And becauſe there is one Odd Row, take the exact half of that diſtance (by doubling the Chain) &amp; ſet from R. to L. then with the whole length go betwixt B. L. thruſting in a Stake at each length, and here you ſhall find three diſtances and the half that was ſet off at the Angle R. Thus two ſides ar Staked out, and he that can do this, can alſo Stake out the other two, ſeeing the oppoſite ſides are anſwerable: for as A. B. is to H. L. ſo is L. B. unto H. A.</p>
                     <p>When the plot is ſtaked out round, let one ſtand at X, and view
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53203:16"/>to B. &amp; another at O. and view to R. cauſe a third, ſet a ſtake in line with both, as at Q. Thus you may proceed from ſtake to ſtake, till all the plot be marked out, ſtill minding the way of your viewing.</p>
                     <p>A Plot will contain more Trees this way, than any other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The two Plots, fig. 5. and 7. are both alike in ſhape and quantity, each containing one Acre, 2 Roods, 16 Falls , 30 Ells: and fig. 7. holds 11 Trees more than fig. 5. planted at one and the ſame diſtance.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A fourth way of planting, is that which I ordinarly uſe in thickets: (ſee fig. 8.) for when the Trees growes large, every other row (ſuppoſe the ſhort ones) may be taken out, that the reſt may have freedom, and ſo be benifited by Sun and Air, where one Fruit-tree will bear more than ſower crouded on others, and yet continue in as good order; and in part anſwers ſome complaining while their Orchards are young, as having few Fruit, ſeeing the more Trees there be while ſuch, the more fruit to be expected, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when their branches begin to meet, remove them as is ſaid, lop and plant by your Hedges, I mean by the diviſors of your Corn Land, and they being now great, are able to defend themſelves. Its alſo applicable to Forreſt-trees ſeeing while they are young, they afford little Shelter, except more than ordinary thick, and yet when they grow large cannot proſper to that ſtately magnitude, unlelſs the ſame cure be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the removal of each ſecond row, which may be effectually planted about the Bordures of your Corn Land, Medow and Paſture, who now needs no fence ſave a few thorns hanged about to keep the Cattle from Rubbing, which thornes they are now well able to bear, albeit ſmall Trees are not: for the winds take great hold on ſuch. Moreover in Orchards, if the ſhort Rowes be Cherries and Plumes, they not being long lived, will be paſt their beſt e'r the Aples and Pears (which may be in the long rowes) require their Room from them.</p>
                     <p>As to the methode you muſt mark out the plot round about, as in my firſt, and view from Angle to Angle of each Geometrical ſquair;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53203:17"/>but then the diſtance of the outter Row about, muſt be more than in the firſt way, otherwiſe the Trees will ſtand much nearer. As 7. is to 5. ſo is the diſtance of the outter row about to the diſtance of the Trees through the Plot.</p>
                     <p>Or you may plant it by viewing from oppoſite ſides, as in my firſt way, only you muſt plant the out-line of ſtakes round about, at half the former diſtance, and let the Stake-ſetter paſs by every other diſtance (except you mean to plant Goosberries, and Curran-Standards in theſe blanks, and then the Trees and Shrubs together makes it Intirely one with the firſt way,) and now the proportion is, as 7 is to 10: ſo is the diſtance of the outter row about, to the diſtance of the Trees; or as 10 is to 7: ſo the diſtance of the Trees to the diſtance of the outter row about. Such proportion doth the ſide, and diagonal of a Geometrical ſquair, bear the one unto the other exact enough for our purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The fifth way, and very notable, where Orchard and Kitchen Garden are all one, or where you have Corn or Graſs amongſt your Trees, or Trees (whither barren or Fruit) among your Corn or Graſs, (<hi>ſee fig.</hi> 9.)</p>
                     <p>If for Kitchen Garden, divide it in Ridges, making the Tables or Pathes in the midle of the wideſt Intervall, and then ſubdivide ſo as the Trees may fall in the midle of the Beds, or Bordures. If for Corn-land, the ridg muſt be between each row, plowed within ſower foot on each ſide the rowes or ranges of Trees: which eight foot Bordures muſt be delved each ſpring; or if ſtiff clay, at both equinoxes, and no vegitable ſuffered to grow thereon. For a man or two with large and handſome hawes 10 Inches broad, will quickly go through them in Summer, and cut the weeds at their firſt peeping: this would certainly be a great Improvement; and whither you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Corn or Graſs, Fruit or Forreſt-trees, I would adviſe you to keep them thus clean of weeds, and if ever you repent it, blame me.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. A ſixt way of planting Trees is, to make all the walkes or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalls open from the Houſe proportionally, ſo as when you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53203:17"/>ſtand at the Houſe, the walkes may appear all of an equal beadth to the eye, this would ſuit well with my contrivance of the Houſe, being like the Sun ſending forth his beams.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The diſtance of Trees in Thickets and Orchards, is either according to the quality of the ground, Trees to be planted, or methode of planting.</p>
                     <p>If a good and deep ſoil, there Trees will live long and grow great and requires a large diſtance: Apples planted the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>, and 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>, way may be from 8 to 10 ells diſtance: Pears ſo planted at 10 or 12 Ells, and of theſe planted the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> way may be at the leaſt diſtance mentioned, becauſe they will ſtand near the greateſt when every ſecond is removed; but if planted the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> way they may be from 16 to 20 Ells one way, and from 8 to 10 the other: Cherries and Plumes from 5 to 7 Ells being planted the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>, or 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> way; as for the diſtance of dwarfs and Wall-trees, ſee the next Chap. Sect. 5.</p>
                     <p>At the Pears diſtance plant Oak, Elm, Aſh, Plan, Beach, Wallnut, Cheſnut; at the Aples diſtance plant Geens, Service, Lines, Poplars; at the diſtance of Plum and Cherrie plant Maple, Hornbeam, Haſſell, Birch, Laburnum, Aſpen, Aſder, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, Pin, Firr, Yew. And ſee the laſt Chap. Sect. 7. for more directions.</p>
                     <p>If the ground be level, plant ſuch Trees as grow loweſt, at the South-ſide, and ſtill higher by degrees towards the North, that the taleſt and ſtrongeſt may be on the North-ſide; ſo ſhall the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren blaſts be guarded off, and the Sun-beames the better received in amongſt them. If the ground be not level, plant ſuch as grow low, on the higheſt ground, and the contrary. And ſet alwayes the crooked or leaning ſide, towards the Southweſt; whence comes the greateſt winds, which in few years will make them the more erect: for you may ſee that all Trees that are not well, ſhelte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from theſe Weſterly winds, leans or declines therefrom.</p>
                     <p>When the ground is all marked out with ſtakes, put on the roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dig ſtring, and make the holes. See the laſt Chap. Sect. 7. I uſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53203:18"/>not to make them leſs than 6 foot Diameter for ordinary Trees, and you may ſuffer the outter row of ſtakes to ſtand, till you plant the reſt that you may view thereby.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How to make the Kitchen Garden.</head>
                     <p>THE Kitchen-Garden is the beſt of all Gardens, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. In all Gardens it is ordinary firſt to make a Bordure at the Wall. Secondly a walke. And thridly a Bordure on the other ſide thereof; here, the walke with a Bordure on each ſide of it, going round the whole plot, Parallel to the Wall: but if your ground be large enough, I bid you make a diſtance Intercept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the walk and the Wall. Its alſo ordinary to divide the Garden into four plots, by two walkes croſſing from ſide to ſide: but I am not for any croſs walkes in Gardens; yet if you would have more than one, (which divides the whole into two parts) then make them all one way through the plot leading to the Houſe, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant from the midle, ſtill making the gates, doors or entries Front the walkes.</p>
                     <p>In your Kitchen-plots, &amp; in Nurſeries for Trees, plant no Trees through the ground: for when they grow up, they cover and choak the ground ſo, that you will be neceſſitate to ſeek for another. Therefore, make only three Bordures next and Parallel to the walkes round on each hand: plant the firſt or that next the walke on both ſides, with a holly Hedg, the ſecond with Goosberries and currans, the thrid with dwarff Trees, the ground all open and void within for Kitchen-herbes and Roots; which muſt be orderly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53203:18"/>divided into ridges; and theſe again divided into Beds, Furrowes, and Drills for your more orderly and convenient planting and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As for the proportion note that.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The walkes muſt be in breadth according to their length <hi>viz.</hi> 1000 foot long, 30 foot broad, 500 foot long, 20 foot broad, 250 in length, 15 in breadth, 100 foot long, 10 foot broad.</p>
                     <p>The Bordures 6 foot broad, the Tables or Pathes betwixt the Bordures 2 foot broad, and theſe betwixt the level-Ridges (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ground is divided) 3 foot broad, the Beds 6 foot broad with foot and half furrowes; you may make 7 of them Beds in each Ridg, and the whole length of the plot all Running from the Houſe: but if your ground be ſmall you may make your Bordures and Beds nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, yet ſtill let the whole plot, Ridges, Bordures, and Beds be equally divided, and their Areas or Edges three Inches higher than the furrows or pathes, and ſo much higher than the ſide of walkes, as the middle of the walk is higher than its ſides, all hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly clapt up with the Rakehead, by a line: (and the like order you may obſerve in your ſeminaries and Nurſeries of Trees) then plant and ſow by lines and Drills, both for beauty and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.</p>
                     <p>When you would do this divide the Bed, Bordure or Ridg at both ends into ſo many equal parts: (by help of the long Rule and ſmall ſticks) then ſtreatch on the line from end to end by theſe ſticks, and with the corner of the Rule make a marke by the line, and therein ſet your Herbes and Plants; and for ſetting of ſeeds, meaſure out, and ſtreatch on the line as before, and with the ſetting ſtick make the holes by the line (not too deep) and therein put the ſeeds. And if you ſow in drills, make a ſcratch or little ebb gutter with the point of the ſtick by the line, and therein ſow. If the rowes be two foot diſtance, let the firſt be one foot within the edg; if 6 Inches ſundry make them 3 Inches off the edge, and ſo proportionally. Note, that I have told the diſtances of each ſort Kitchen horbes and Fruits part 2. Chap. 6. where is intended 6 foot broad beds, but where they are leſs, there muſt be fewer rowes.</p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53203:19"/>
                     <p n="3">3. The Kitchen Garden may be placed, its half on each ſide the Houſe and Courts, and when you plant or ſow, place every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by themſelves (except ſuch mixture as is mentioned part 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 3.) and where you have not a whole Ridge or at leaſt a bed of a kind, you may compleat them with ſuch as are neareſt of growth and continuance: alſo plant them of long laſt, and them that muſt be yearly renewed ſeverally, each in Ridges or beds by themſelves orderly; the order is to make every ſort oppoſe it ſelf. Example if you plant a Ridge of Artichocks on the one hand, plant another at the ſame place on the other: and ſtill where you have perennialls on the one ſide, ſet the ſame ſort at the ſame place on the other; and ſo of Annualls. In ſhort, what ever you have on the one ſide, you ſhould have the ſame in every circumſtance on the other. Perennialls are ſuch plants as continues many years in the ground, Annualls are ſuch as uſually dy immediatly after once they bear ſeed, and that is uſually (thô not univerſally) the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As for phyſical plot you may have them in that ridge of the Kitchen Garden next the Bordures: and if you will to have no other pleaſure Garden, you may have Flowers there, and on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures next the walkes alſo: and that ridge or Intervall betwixt the walke and Wall will be excellent for all early, rare and tender plants. You may rill your Phyſick Herbes in Tribes and Kindreds, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every Tribe by themſelves, and you may alſo place one of each kind in the Alphabetical order.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. How to order hedges, ſee part 2. Chap. 4. as for Walls, Brick is beſt, next is Stone and Lime; 4 Ells is low enough, 5 or 6 if you pleaſe: but if you would make the South-looking Wall ſemicircles in it, that would conduce much to the advantadge of the Fruit, as well as Hot-beds under it; The diſtance of Wall-trees will Informe you what quantity to make them, as for example 15 foot is the diſtance of Cherries and Plumes, (except ſuch as the <hi>May</hi> cherrie which being Dwarfiſh requires leſs) 18 foot for Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coks &amp; Peaches, 20 foot for Aples, 24 for Pears. Therefore if you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53203:19"/>make the ſemicircumference 18 foot for Apricoks and Peaches, (you may plant two Dwarff Cherries therein) then 36 is the whole Perifery, and as 22 is to 7: ſo is 36 the Perifery to 11½ fere the Diameter; and having the Diameter you may eaſily make any part of the Circle: and let the plain or ſtraight Wall betwixt each ſemicircle be juſt one Trees diſtance likewayes.</p>
                     <p>And alſo in ſtraight Walls divide equally, and plant non in the Corners, meaſure firſt off 6 foot on each ſide the gates or doors for Honiſuckles, Jaſmines, &amp;c. And whatever be the diſtance of your Trees, ſet them half therefrom, as alſo from the Corners, except where you make all their heads ply one way; (as on a low Wall) ſuch may ſtand three foot off the Corners, or Honiſuckles they lean from, and a whole diſtance off theſe they lean towards. You may plant a Goosberrie and curran in the intervalls of your Wall-trees while young, &amp; when the Trees approach, remove them. Let the Roots of your Wall-trees ſtand near a foot from the Wall with their heads inclining towards the ſame. Wall-trees in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards (whoſe Standards are in the Quincunx) ſhould ſtand oppoſite to the mid intervall of the Standards.</p>
                     <p>The diſtance of Dwarff Standards is 16 foot where there is but one row, and in following this Rule of the three Bordures, they will ſtand juſt 16 foot off the Hedg, obſerving to plant in the midle of the Bordures. The diſtance of Goosberries and currans 6 foot. But in all your plantings and ſowings divide the ground ſo as each kind may ſtand &amp; grow equally.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, theſe three Bordures going round at each ſide of the walkes handſomly made up and planted, as aforeſaid, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ground within from hurtful winds and colds, and make people keep the walkes (handſome pale doors being on the entries of the Hedges) ſo as they may neither wrong you nor themſelves. Alſo the Hedge, Dwarff Standards, Shrubs, and Wall-trees being all well prun'd and plyed, with the Bordures and walkes clean and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly kept, will make it look like a Garden of pleaſure, and hide all the Ruggedneſs that happeneth in Kitchen-ground by delving, dunging, turning and overturning throughout the year.</p>

                     <p>PLeaſure-Gardens uſeth to be divided into walkes and plots, with a Bordure round each plot, and at the corner of each, may be a holly or ſome ſuch train'd up, ſome Pyramidal, others Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the Trees and Shrubs at the Wall well plyed and prun'd, the Green thereon cut in ſeveral Figures, the walkes layed with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and the plots within with Graſs, (in ſeveral places whereof may be Flower pots) the Bordures boxed, and planted with variety of Fine Flowers orderly Intermixt, Weeded, Mow'd, Rolled, and kept all clean and handſome.</p>
                     <p>Plain draughts at only in uſe, and moſt preferable; that which I eſteem is plain ſtraight Bordures and Pathes running all one way, that is, from the Houſe with one walke parting it in the midle, leading to the Houſe door: and if the ground be large, you may make one round by the Wall too, as the pleaſure-Garden of fig. 1. Let the Bordures and Pathes be both of a breadth, (<hi>viz.</hi> 6 foot) box the Bordures, and plant them with Flowers, lay the pathes as well as the walkes with Gravel, plant the Walls with Fruit and Flower-bearing Trees variouſly.</p>
                     <p>Outter Courts hath only one Bordure at the Wall, planted with Laurels and other Greens, one Pathed or Brick-walk in the midle, leading to the midle of the Houſe-front with along Graſs plot on each hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Bordures of your Kitchen-Garden round by the walkes may be boxed with <hi>Thyme, Lavendar, Hyſop, Rue,</hi> &amp;c. the next with <hi>Parſly, Strawberries, Violets, July-flowers,</hi> &amp;c. Cherrie-gardens and Phyſick-gardens with Sweet-brier often cut, or <hi>Box</hi> cut three times <hi>Per annum</hi> as <hi>April, June, Auguſt,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cut their Roots at the inſide every ſecond year, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt no the ſtrength or nouriſhment of the Flowers or Herbes. But
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53203:20"/>that which I preferre for Flower-Gardens above all, is <hi>Dwarff-Juniper</hi> raiſed from the ſeed and Planted thus, When the ground is levelled, meaſure out the Bordures, (but raiſe them not above the walkes, except you minde to lay gravel) ſtreatch a line and with the edge of the Rule mark alongſt thereby, and therein ſet the young ſets of <hi>Box</hi> or the young Plants of <hi>Juniper</hi> at 2 years grouth; then prepare the Bordures by delving in conſum'd dung of Cowes and Sheep, covering on a little lime topt with a little ſand, to ly all ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, kept clean from by hawing. At the beginning of winter delve and mix together, to ly all winter un-Raked, and at the Spring redelve, ſtirr and mix it throughly, and train and plant your Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other Plants in their ſeaſons. See Part 2. Chap: 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In making the walkes in any Gardens, firſt level up the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures at its ſides, ſecondly drive a Row of Stakes in the midle of the walke, and level them accordingly <hi>i. e.</hi> ſtreatch line croſs the walke betwixt the two level Bordures, and marke where it hits the Stake in the midle of the walke; do this at both ends, and viewing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, will levell the reſt, ſee the next Chap: of levelling. But you may mind, that the walk muſt riſe a little in the midle, and yet the midle of the walke, and top of the Boxing of the Bordure muſt be level, <hi>i.e.</hi> The Boxings ſo much above the ſide of the walk, as the midle of the walke is above its ſides. Where your Boxing is timber or Stone, fill up the bordure of Earth to the top thereof, but where your Boxing is of box-juniper or the like, the Earth within the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and edg of the walks and pathes without, muſt be equal. As for the riſe or ſwell that walkes has which makes them Segmenta Circuli, graſs or brick walkes may have for 30 foot broad 6 Inches riſe, for 20 foot 4 Inches, 10 foot 2 Inches; and let gravel have an Inch more proportionally: and it agrees with the rule of proport: in Arithmetick, as 20 is to 4: ſo is 30 to 6. If gravell or brick walkes or pathes ly by the ſide of graſs, make the graſs half Inche higher than ſuch. If the walke be Graſs, make 2 foot Tables, or pathes of gravel betwixt it and the Bordure.</p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53203:21"/>
                     <p n="4">4. To lay graſs, firſt level the ground, whither walke or plot; and its the better to ly a year ſo made up, before you lay the turff; becauſe it may be levelled up again, if it ſink unto holes: If it ly wet, bottome with Stones and Rubiſh; and if the Earth be fat, take it out, and put in ſand; however lay a foot thick ſand immediatly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Truff: then by the ſquair ſtreatch lines, Ritt with the Ritting Iron (which is an half round put into the end of a crooked ſtick) &amp; raiſe the Turff with the Turff-Spade, (which is broad mouthed, otherwiſe all one with the Husbandmens breaſt-Turffing-ſpade) let the Turff be of equal thickneſs, near Inch and half thick, a foot and half broad, and as much in length, lay their green ſides toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when you put them in the cart, but do not Roll them when brought home, lay them all even and cloſs; Feeling each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Turff with your foot, ſo as you may diſcern any Inequallity, to be helped Immediatly, in laying ſtill, beating every two three rowes of turff while moiſt, with the Timber beatters, and when the the whole is layed, and well beat, Roll well with the Stone-Roller, which ſhould be as big as a hogſehead, The Spring and Autumne is the beſt time. And if you mind to keep a good pile of Graſs, ſuffer it never to grow Inch long: beat, mow, and Roll of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, eſpecially in the mornings and moiſt weather.</p>
                     <p n="5">5, But if you would lay the hard tile or brick walkes, prepare as for Graſs, minding it wants the breadth of the brick of the true hight: for you muſt ſet them all on their edg cloſs by other on a bed of lime, laying the ſide, each other Row croſſing the ends of the other, and place one in the midle of the walkes that both ſides may be Regular.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To lay gravel, cleanſe firſt the bottomes of the walkes of fat Earth, and Root weeds, and bottom it with Stones; and lay over that about half a foot of clean round gravel, and about three Inches top gravel of equal greatneſs which may be like beans and peaſe: you muſt make it thus equal by ſifting, and ſo Rake, Tred, and beat; and when compleatly levelled, beart well with the Timber beaters, while moiſt, then Roll ſoundly with the Timber-Roller,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53203:21"/>and afterwards with the Stone-Roller, eſpecially in Rain, for which the ſpring and Autumn is beſt; but if dry weather, you muſt daſh water one the Roller (continually in Rolling) with the watering pott, and if you ar forced to uſe Sea or water ſand, you may beat ſome good clay to duſt and mix with ſuch, before you lay it; weed, and Roll frequently.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. For the orderly planting of flowers there may be three wayes, as firſt in the Bordures of pleaſure Gardens or Courts, plant 5 rowes in the bordure, and Intermixe them orderly <hi>i. e.</hi> divide and plant every ſundry ſort through the whole Garden at equal diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not only ſo but every ſundry colour thereof alſo; let ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver two of a kind nor two of a colour ſtand together, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds and colours Interveening, ſo as there may not be two, three of a kind or Colour at one end, Bordure, Plot or Place, and non thereof through the reſt, but univerſally and ornamentally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt, and when you find a breach by ſome being paſt the flower, you may have various Annual Flowers ſowen in potts, ready to plunge into the vacancies of the Bordures for continuing this beauty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in my ſort of flower Gardens which is Bordures and pathes running all one way <hi>viz:</hi> from the Houſe, Plant 5 rowes and intermix them, not as in the laſt way, but ſet 5 rowes of each kind croſs the Bordure, ſo as 25 of each ſort may ſtand in a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical ſquair. As if you ſet a ſquair of Tulips, a ſquair of Boars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ears a ſquair of Crocuſes, a ſquair of July Flowers, a ſquair of Anemonies, and a ſquair of Couſlips: and ſo a ſquair of Tulips, another of Boars Ears, &amp;c: Through that Bordure Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing the Colours of each ſort, then may you make the next Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo Intermixt, but differing: minding that as you Intermix the Bulbous and Fibrous in each Bordure, ſo muſt they be alſo in the croſſing, that the ſquair of Fibrous in this may oppoſe the ſquair of Bulbous in the next, and likewayes whatever Bordure ſuch ſorts at in, on the one ſide of the walke, ſet the very ſame in the Bordure equidiſtant from the walke on the other ſide, that the whole may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53203:22"/>be Regular and uniformely Intermixt all the year, looking from all ſides, ends or Angles.</p>
                     <p>Thridly in nurſeries of Beds and Ridges, Plant every kind in thickets by themſelves, and Annualls and perennialls by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (except only that you Intermix their Coloures) that is, make a whole Bed or Ridg of each kind, 6 Rowes in the Bed, the Dwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh may be 8 Rowes: thus every thicket of them Flowering in their own order, will have a great ſhew, and at a great diſtance; and here alſo obſerve uniformity, that is, alike on each hand, ſee the laſt Chap: ſect: 3. For if you have a Ridg or Bed of <hi>July-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> or the like on the one ſide, Plant another thereof at the ſame place on the other, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe Flowers muſt be removed ſome in one, two, or three years, and the Earth renued or enriched, and properly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, elſe they degenerate; (becauſe in long time they exhauſt the ſubſtance of the ground, at leaſt that part appropriate to them) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have a good conveniency for effectuating the ſame by theſe laſt two models perſcribed: for often you will have ſome Beds or ſquairs where your Annualls ſtood, to replant your Tulips, Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or the like unto, and ſo another ſort where theſe ſtood, and your Annualls again where this laſt was; and becauſe here you remove a whole Bed or ſquair of a kind at once, you may very conveniently prepare, Delve, Stir, Beat, ſift and mix it throughly with the ſoyl proper (a thing moſt neceſſary) and this you could not well do, where they ar ſcattred as in the firſt way. See the Rules mentioned Part 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 10. and Chap. 7.</p>
                     <p>As to Terraſe walkes, if the Brow on which you make them, be not too ſteep, the work ſhall be the more Facile: if you build them up with walls, be careful to found deep enough according to the level, and if the midle of the terraſe be on the Central line of the houſe or of any walke, make the Stayr of the upmoſt and downmoſt there to part at a plat on the head going down at both ſides, ſo much of the ſtayr caſe may be within as that the outter edg thereof may be in a line with the Bordure at the wall, by this it marrs not the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53203:22"/>walke, the reſt may be at the ends; Plant the Bordure at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſide of the walke with wall Trees, the under ſide (being but ell high) with Laurels: &amp;c. But if your Terraſe conſiſts only of walkes and ſloping Banks, you may have the Bordure at the head and foot of each Bank on either ſide the walkes, Planted with ſtandard cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries &amp;c. and the Banks, of <hi>Violets, Straw-Berries</hi> or Graſs.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. As for Pondes make them large and broad, ſuch being beſt both for the health of Fiſh and Fowll, Clean, and moſt preferrable water for watering Plants: ſquair, Triangle, Circle, Ovall, or what figure ſits your ground beſt; let them be 5 or 6 foot of ſolid water at leaſt, with Sluces to let it Run in and out at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>I am againſt Arbuſt and cloſe walkes except Trees their natural cloſing, where we have both ſhade and Air.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP: 7.</hi> How to Level Ground.</head>
                     <p>I Have often wiſhed that there might be ſome Rules found, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this expenſive worke might become more eaſy. There be two ſorts of levelling <hi>viz:</hi> the Horizontal, and Sloping. The firſt is beſt known, but the laſt more profitable and convenient. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I have made a plot ſlop 4 foot in 200 long, and 18 Inches in 380 foot the other way: this was not perſpicuous to vulgar eyes, yet to have made it Horizontal, would have been Ridiculous as to time, paines and expences. And in levelling the walkes about a plot (which ſloped naturally) to make them correſpond with the grownd rownd, I behoved to make the midle walk agree with the ſide ones whereupon it ſlops 10 foot in 370 long: now if I had made this Horizontal, it would have been 5 foot or 10 ſteps lower than the one ſide walke, and as much higher than the other, and ſo worſe and more Inconvenient than before, both as it is a walke,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53203:23"/>and anent Correſpondancy with the reſt of the ground within; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am for levelling any ground ſloping, that it may turn a little to the Sun if poſſible, for drawing water, that it may correſpond with its adjuncts, and above all to prevent the more coſtly way: for Its certainly a principal obſervation in levelling, not only to cauſe, the ground of it ſelf ſerve it ſelf, but alſo to level it as it lyes moſt conveniently, which is the cheap and eaſie way of levelling. When you have a Row of ſtakes ſet in a ſtraight line and about 20 foot diſtance, as in the edge of a Bordure or midle of a walke, the way of levelling them either Horizontal or ſloping, is to mark and put a nail in the two Stakes which ar at the extreams or ends thereof, and view betwixt, cauſe marke all the Reſt which ar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, in a level line, therewith; This is the eaſieſt, the exacteſt and quickeſt way: and in the ſame methode you may go round any plot, and conſequently croſs (every way) the ſame accordingly.</p>
                     <p>In that which you would have Horizontal, place the long Rule and the level at one end, ſuppoſe the ſole of the Door, till the plumb fall right in recovering, and view alongſt the ſaid Rule (as on a fowlling piece) that you may ſee what part of each Stake it hits, and cauſe one with a piece white paper or white hefted knife hold the ſame at each ſtake, its heft tending out (as the nails which carry up the line) and direct him by words or ſignes to hold up or down till it be Juſt level: when they ar all marked, meaſure down ſo much on each Stake, as was raiſed up for conveniency; in viewing there marke, put in nailes a little, ſtreatch on the line, and level up the earth or gravel thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And where you would have determin'd ſlops, ſet on the level and marke the far-end ſtake in a level line therewith, then meaſure down upon the ſaid Stake or pole from the marked place ſo much as you deſigne the ſlop, and put in a naile with white paper about it, and at the upperſide of the Rule in the ſtake at the door, put in another nail, and by viewing betwixt theſe two, marke all the reſt as before. If the diſtance betwixt the extreams be farr where the ſight may dazle, let the viewer deſcent his ſtation, and come foreward at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53203:23"/>every 5 or 6 Stakes and holding his knife at the laſt marked Stake, cauſe his aſſiſtant or ſtake-marker proceed.</p>
                     <p>To level as the ground lyes, let its ſlop be what it will you need neither level nor Rule (except you pleaſe to try how much it ſlops after its done for ſatisfaction) only ſet ſtakes as before, and viewing the ground narrowly put nails in the ſtakes which are at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams where you think the ground will Run when levelled to make it ſerve it ſelf, and as it lyes beſt or eaſieſt for levelling: and when you have concluded upon the level at the extreams, make all the ſtakes in the Intervall by viewing as above.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But to proportion the level to the ground is the whole art of levelling. Its true it is eaſie, if you have a plot or walke a foot hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher at one end, to take half a foot thereof, and lay on the low end ſo as the two ends may be Horizontal, (I have already ſhew'd how to level having the two ends found) or if it be Horizontal to take 9 Inches off the one end, and lay on the other, that it may ſlop 18 Inches: but if ſome places of it ly one way, and ſome another, and ſome neither the one nor the other, this increaſeth the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherefore you muſt firſt drive ſtakes at the corners of the plot, then view the ground about and put nayles in the ſtakes where you would have the level Run, or at leaſt where you think by your eye it may moſt conveniently come to make it contain it ſelf, and eaſieſt to be levelled: alſo ſet up ſeveral ſtakes in the Intervalls and Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes through the plot from oppoſite Angles, and by viewing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the foreſaid nailes every way marke all the ſtakes level; but if you cannot ſee from the markes of this ſuppoſed level which are on theſe corner ſtakes, ſeeing there may be ſome underneath the ground, little Hills, or ſome ſuch obſtructions in the way, then meaſure equally up upon each of them, ſo farr as you think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for getting your ſight, and mind to take down the ſame again after viewing.</p>
                     <p>When all is marked with this ſuppoſed level, go over and note narrowly how it will agree, that ſo as your reaſon ſhall teach you to alter, take up one end or down the other, or up or down both till
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53203:24"/>you bring it to ſuch proportion, as to do its own buſineſs it ſelf. Or you may do more exactly thus.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe you have a Bordure or midle of a walke with ſixteen ſtakes driven therein at 20 foot diſtance, all marked with a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed level, and 10 of their markes above ground, and 6 under ground: firſt meaſure how farr the markes on each of the 10 ſtakes is above ground, and write them down particularly, and adding their meaſures together, you find 13 foot 4 Inches. Secondly meaſure how farr the markes of the 6 ſtakes ar under ground, &amp; write down, adding them together you find it 12 foot; ſubſtract the one from the other and the difference is 16 Inches which muſt be divided by 16 the ſtakes in the Bordure, that is, ane Inch to each ſtake, ſo that this ſuppoſed level is an Inch higher over all than the true level, which being taken down will make the ground there level it ſelf, and no more. This may ſuffice for example, but I could ſay more, if I did ſee your ground. And if you can thus proportion the level to one Bordure, walke, or one Row of ſtakes, you may by the ſame Rule find the level for the ſtakes round and croſs the plot, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently level the ſame accordingly: for having once concluded on the level, drive ſtakes over all the plot as in my firſt way of planting Trees, (ſee Chap. 4. Sect. 4.) and marke and put nailes therein as above is taught for carrying the line. Except you mean to follow my method of levelling the Kitchen-Garden, or the like for planting and ſowing, which is only to level one Bordure thus by ſtakes and lines. Round each plot and by the eye level up the ground within thereunto all along in Trenching, albeit this not ſo proper for Courts and Graſs plots. However as by this means, I uſe to level ground without a level, ſo do I think this way of finding out the true level by means of a ſuppoſed one, worthy your notice, and if rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven ſave you much money and paines.</p>
                     <p>Be cautious in founding your Walls leſt you undermine them in levelling, nor is it convenient ſometimes to confine your level to the foundation of Walls already built: for in ſo doing, you may loſe more, than would caſt down and rebuild, but in ſuch caſes you may rather build under gradually.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53203:24"/>
                     <p n="3">3. There be ſome bad lying plots and walkes, with an aſcent at the head, hollow in the midle, level at the foot, theſe and the like are very troubleſome to level under one denomination: for the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Hill, bares it ſo, that plants cannot proſper thereon. ſome ar neceſſitate to take out the Gravel, Tile, or Stones ſo much deeper, and travell earth again: but I rather adviſe to make terraſes, you need not confine to the number of banks, but only to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uniformity. If it tend all one way as high at one end and low at the other, then its proper enough for perpendicular walkes that front the houſe, but if low in the midle and high at both ends, or low at both ends and high in the midle, then more proper for Parallel walkes, (whoſe extremities are equidiſtant from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral line of the Houſe) remember to divide and ſlop them equally.</p>
                     <p>This minds me of ſome abuſes, which I have ſeen, as a plot of ſloping levelled ground, with another Horizontaly levelled lying at the foot thereof, (at leaſt not under one ſlop) or Horizontal walkes and bordures lying by the foot and head of ſloping plots; theſe are unſeemly: for you ſhould allwayes make them ſlop under the ſame denomination (except in ſteep and high banks) I have made walkes of 18 foot broad ſlop 18 Inches from one ſide to the other, becauſe the whole plot ſloped the ſame way, ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally, yet to the eye appears very pleaſant; but where ſuch Horizontal and ſloping pieces ly contiguous, the defect is eaſily ſeen, therefore if you be neceſſitate to lay ſome plots ſo, (albeit I know reaſon for laying walkes ſo) make rather a Hedg to Intercept, and in all your workes let there be a connexion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There be ſome more obſtructions in levelling, as in a long walke when you have the two ends found and marked, (either with a ſuppoſed or true level) and cannot ſee betwixt, to do it exactly by reaſon of length: here two may go to the midle or near it, where you may conveniently ſee both ends, looking back and fore, there drive in two ſtakes near the length of the long ſtraight Rules di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, at which hold on the Rule, and let one view alongſt the ſame till the marke at the Weſt-end be level therewith, and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53203:25"/>other towards the Eaſt
till the marke there be alſo level with the ſame; ſo both may alter up or down till they have their deſires at once: then ſix the Rule, and having as many ſtakes ſet as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, you may view backſight and foreſight hereon, and level them all exactly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But if a Wall, a Houſe, &amp;c. Intercept, meaſure perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and exactly up to the top thereof, and on the other ſide mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure down the ſame again; and ſo ſet foreward the level, but ſo as it may communicate with the reſt, when obſtructions are removed.</p>
                     <p>But if a Hill, go to the Top, ſet the Rule level, and laying ane eye thereto, cauſe one with a long pole go down till its Top be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel therewith (he holding it level by a Plumb Rule) then deſcent your ſtations and ſet the upper-end of the Rule where the pole ſtood, there level it and do as before: thus from ſtation to ſtation to the foot of the Hill, (if it be ſo great) keeping compt in a Note-book what poles and parts; the which may be as eaſily taken down the other ſide by the ſame method.</p>
                     <p>But if it be poſſible to ſee over the obſtruction on 3 footed ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leathers by help of long poles or Pikes, (as I have done in the like caſe) raiſe your level thereon, and having viewed, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that on the other ſide, meaſure down the ſame there, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I might here ſpeak of the ſolidity of earth, whereby you may move readily compt the expence of levelling, but having ſhew'd in the next Chap. Sect. 5. How to meaſure ſolids, I preſume its appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to earth: (as well as Timber, Stone, &amp;c.) For if you know the breadth, length, and deepth thereof, you may find how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſolid Ells, &amp;c. And if you know how many Ells and parts will load a cart and how many carts a day, you may go near to calculat the coſt of the whole.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In levelling any ground for Kitchen ground, Orchards, or Nurſeries, take not away its good earth or ſurface, (as you bring down the hights) but alwayes turn over the upper-part thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you, carrying away that which is below, ſo much deeper, that it may contain that ſurface, and put the bad earth in bottom of hollowes with better mould above it.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:53203:25"/>
                     <p>In the practiſe of levelling (or other workes) contrive the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo as there may be ſtill a motion amongſt all the partes; and albeit carts are cheaper for levelling than Wheell-barrowes, if the way of carriage be not very ſhort, yet if you do not ſet as many men to fill the carts as may have the one full againſt the other come in and no more, you loſe conſiderably: and this will be according to the diſtance of carriage, or as the earth is capable of being wrought; and ſo with Wheell-barrowes for two Wheellers, three barrowes, and one filler ſometimes doth well, ſometimes more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or fewer Wheellers, yet ſtill let them have a led barrow. And if this could be done with carts alſo, it would be of great Advantage. wherefore in my opinion there is no way ſo probable to worke this effect, as the carts with three Wheells where by 2. men, with 2. of them carts, and one Horſe can do as much as three Men, two Horſes, and 2 Carts: for one man to fill the led Cart, the other Man to drive the one Horſe: and when he comes in, he has nothing to do but take the Traſes and Hooks off the empty Cart and put upon the rings of the full one and ſo drive on. This Cart has no Trams or Limbers, but a Swingle-Tree or Bread-board be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where the rings that keeps the Traſſes are: it has a handſome folding body, the thrid Wheell is about 30 Inches Diameter all Iron and Runs in a Shiers of the ſame faſtned perpendicular under the midle of the forebreaſt with a turning Pin of Iron; the other two Wheells are common, but if they have an Iron Axis, the better.</p>

Conſider on the level, for as the place where you convey it unto, muſt allwayes be lower than the Fountain from whence it comes, elſe thither it cannot flow: ſo muſt you take notice that no Hill in the way of its conveyance be ſo high as the Fountain it ſelf. You may find the level by placing your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument at the Well or Fountain, as I directed in walkes. and if a Hill intercept that ſight, plant on the Top thereof, that by back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and foreſight you may find the difference, that hence you may know whither you can carry it about the obſtruction: but if
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53203:26"/>the diſtance be farr, you need to be the more exact. As for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Croſs diſcribed Chap. 3. whoſe ſights may be two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Glaſſes, may do well whither for one or many ſtations. Let one ſtand at the Spring-head, another betwixt and the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you deſire to carry the Water, a large diſtance ſundry, but ſo as a thrid man about the midle may ſee both their Marke-boards that is on their Pikſtaves, and direct them to hold level by his back and foreſight, deſiring them to keep accompt what foot and parts: and ſo come foreward till the aſſiſtant at the well plant where the foremoſt ſtood, and thus proceed all in a ſtraight line, and do as before, from ſtation to ſtation ſo long as needfull. at length add all the meaſures of back-ſtations together, and all of the fore-ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſubſtract the one from the other, and the remainders gives the difference of levels betwixt the Fountain and the appointed place.</p>

Some would think 12 Inches but a thrid part more, whereas it is equivalent to 2¼ of theirs: for 8 times 8 is 64, and 12 times 12 is 144, out of which I get 2 times 64, and the 16 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining is ¼ thereof.

                     <p>We differ in meaſuring land from the Engliſh, as the fall differs from the pole: our fall is 6 ells or 18½ foot, their pole is 5½ yardes or 16½ foot.</p>
                     <p>By what is ſaid I hope you know wherewith to meaſure, it only remaines then that you know how to meaſure; of which anon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In meaſuring all ſuperficies we take notice of the breadth and length, but of ſolides the breadth, length and deepth. To inſtance in a few, and firſt of ſome Superficial Figures; as a Geometrical ſquair, (ſee fig. 18.) it is meaſured by multiplying one ſide in it ſelf (<hi>viz. a. b.</hi> or <hi>c. e:</hi> or <hi>a. c.</hi> or <hi>b. e.</hi>) which here is 30½ falls:
In your workings I would adviſe you to make uſe of decimal Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, becauſe thereby you may work whole Numbers and Fractions together with great eaſe and quickneſs, and you may reduce ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fractions into decimalls, by multiplying the Numerator by 100. or 1000. &amp;c. and dividing the product by the Denominator, ſo ſhall the ¼ of anything be 25, the ½ 5, and the ¾ 75: therefore multiply 30.5 in its ſelf, the product is 930.25. which is <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 930. falls and ¼ of a fall. See the example, for when you multiply decimally what ever fractions are in multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand and multiplicator, cut them off after addition: the which if there be any will be Fractions, as here you ſee two cut off <hi>viz.</hi> 25 which is ¼ of 100, the fall being here into 100 parts the Integer of 25. And when you divide decimally, as whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Fractions by whole Numbers, put ſtill a daſh betwixt the whole and Fraction, and notice how often you will get your diviſor placed under the whole Numbers of your dividend, and juſt ſo many whole Numbers will be in the quotient and the reſt Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: or if you divide whole and Fractions by whole and Fractions, notice how many times you may place the whole Numbers of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor under whole Numbers of dividend &amp;c. Or if you divide whole Numbers by whole and Fractions, whatever Fractions be in diviſor add ſo many Ciphers to the dividend, and do as before.</p>
                     <p>You may reduce this (or any other) plot into Acres by dividing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53203:27"/>by 160 the falls in one Acre, and the product here will be 5 Acres 130 falls and ¼ of a fall. But if <gap reason="math">

                        </gap> you would further know what this Fraction (25) is in Ells, ſay, if 100 be equall to 36 the ells in one fall what is 25 equall unto? Multiply the 2d Number by the 3d, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by the firſt and the anſwer will be 9 ells. See it wrought.</p>
                     <p>Moreover falls may be reduced into poles, and poles into falls, or <hi>Scots</hi> meaſure into <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>Scots:</hi> one ſuperficies is to another as the ſquairs of their like ſides, therefore as the ſquair of 16.5 (the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) is to the ſquair of 18.5 (the <hi>Scots</hi>) ſo is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in <hi>Scots</hi> Acres or falls, to the content in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acres or poles.</p>
                     <p>Example the ſquair of 16.5 (<hi>i. e.</hi> 16.5 multiplyed in it ſelf) is 272.25 and the ſquair of 18.5 is 342.25, And as 272.25 is to 342.25: ſo is 930.25 (the content of the ſaid plot in falls or <hi>Scots</hi> meaſure) to 1169.43¼ ſere, its content in poles or <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure. This I thought fit to mention, to let any ſee that knows not the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure and ours.</p>
                     <p>Secondly an oblong ſquair or Parallelogram (ſee fig. 19.) by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying the breadth by the length: <hi>a. d.</hi> or <hi>b. c.</hi> is its length and <hi>a. b.</hi> or <hi>d. c.</hi> its breadth.</p>
                     <p>Thridly, a Triangle, (ſee fig. 20.) all Triangles are meaſured by multiplying the whole baſe by half the perpendicular or whole perpend: by half the baſe; <hi>a. b.</hi> is baſe and <hi>i. c.</hi> the perpendicular, or without the perpendicular at all, add up all the ſides, and take half the ſumme; from this half ſumme take every ſide, which call the three differences, multiply theſe three differences and the half ſumme continually together, the ſquair Root of the laſt product ſhall be the Area of the Triangle.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, a Trapezia (ſee fig. 21.) is reduced into two Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and meaſured accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, and ſo is any irregular ſtraight lined figure, and if any ſide of it be crooked, draw a line that may leave out as much as it takes in. But if it cannot be meaſured within becauſe of obſtructions,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53203:28"/>then add on the outſide till you reduce it into a ſquair, and after mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication ſubſtract what was added, the remainder ſhall be its Area.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly a circle (See Fig: 22.) is near equall to a ſquair made of ½ the diameter and ½ the circumference or perifery, and therefore is meaſured by multiplying <hi>a. q. c. o. b.</hi> the Semicircumference by <hi>a. d.</hi> or <hi>d. c.</hi> the ſemidiameter. And having any one given you may find the other by the Rule of proportion thus:</p>
                     <p>The loweſt number is, as 7. is to 22: ſo is the diameter to the Circumference, or as 22. is to 7: ſo the Circumference to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, or thus: As 1. is to 3.1416: ſo the Diameter to the Circum: or as 3.1416. is to 1: ſo the Circum: to the diam: or as 113. to 355: ſo diam: to perifery, or as 355. to 113: ſo perifery to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter.</p>
                     <p>In this the Diameter is 63 falls and as 7. is to 22: ſo 63 (the diam:) to 198 (the perifery) Take ½ perifery which is 99. and multiply by ½: Diameter which is 31.5. and the product is 3118.5. or as 28. is to 22: or 14. to 11: or 1. to 785399: ſo is the ſquair of the Diameter to the Area of the circle: or as 22. to 28: or 11. to 14: or 355. to 452: or 1. to 1.273239: ſo is the Area of the Circle to the ſquair of its diameter. as 1. is to 282095: ſo is the circle to the Root of a ſquair equall to the Area of the circle. as 1. is to 707107: ſo is the Diameter to the Root of a ſquair to be inſcribed in a Circle. as 1. is to 225072: ſo is the perifery to the Root of the inſcribed ſquair in the circle, and as 1. is to 886227: ſo is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter to the Root of a ſquair equall to the Circle, which is the ſquairing of a Circle.</p>

                     <p>If you would cut off ſome part from a ſquair parallel to one ſide, you need only meaſure that ſide, whence you deſigne to take it at; and divide the parts, you ar to take off thereby: and the quotient ſhall tell how much you muſt ſet off.

But upon tryall I find it will ſo work, therefore ſet 7 in the quotient and multiply the ſame, it makes 49 write that down under 54. ſubſtract, and there remains 5. This tells that the Root of the large ſquair is 700. (conſidering that there is yet 2 Figures to follow as appears by the 3 daſhes) now double your quotient, that makes 14 (this is the length of the two oblong ſquairs) place the ſame, as in diviſion, and ſay, how often can we get 14 out of 53. anſwer 3 times and, 11 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; now ſubſtract the little ſquair whole ſide is 3. Thus, 3 times 3 is 9: from 111. remaines 102. There is the Root of other two oblong ſquairs wanting: therefore double the whole quotient <hi>a. b.</hi> 73 that makes 146. place the ſame as before, for diviſion, and ſay, how often can we get 146 out of 1026, or gradually, how often one in 10. we get 9 ones in 10, but not 9 fowers in 12 which will remain. then try if we can have 8. No, therefore take 7 and ſet in the quotient, as before in common diviſion, <hi>viz.</hi> 7 times one from 10. remains 3. and 7. fowers from 23. remains 4. and 7 ſixes from 46. remains 4. laſtly ſubſtract the little ſquair, <hi>viz.</hi> 7 times 7 from 49. there remains nothing.

                     <p>Laſtly by ſeveral wayes of Inoculation.</p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53203:39"/>
                     <p>The buſineſs of this Chap: is to ſhew the manner and time of performing each of theſe wayes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And firſt by ſeeds, choice them from the faireſt Plants, full ripe, the day fair, and Plants dry. Lay them in the Sun and open air a little, ſome for Rubbing out, others for winning in their husks. And as you ſhould not ſow Fruits, Kirneſs, Nuts, or Stones with the Fleſhy part on, (but eat or Rub it off by Rolling in ſand, and then dry them a little) ſo nor waſh, Weet, or ſteep them. Neither keep any long after they ripe, the moſt part will keep till ſpring, but then many will ly till the next, eſpecially ſtony Seeds, Berries, and Kirnells. I do not mean, <hi>Aſh, Holly, Yew, Mezeriom, Hawthorn,</hi> &amp;c. Who naturally lies a year longer, albeit ſowen Immediatly when gathered, yet even ſome of theſe namely the holly will ly ſometimes a year longer than their uſuall time, if the fleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy part be not Rubbed off.</p>
                     <p>I might ſay ſomething of the timely Interring Tulips and others, but I come to the manner of ſowing: which is,</p>
                     <p>To cover the ſeed with the mould, whereof there is ſeveral mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les according to the nature of the ſeed, Soil, ſeaſon, or fancy either to ſow the Ground and turne the ſeed in under the furrow, or by drawing trenches in the ſoil, and then drawing the earth over them with a haw, or ſowing the bed ready dreſt and hacking in the ſeed with the ſame Inſtrument, or by Harrowing, Raking with a Rake or drawing buſhes over the ſowed Ground to cover the ſeed, or to put off the ſurface of the whole bed with the Rake head and ſow thereon, then draw on the mould again with the ſame, and having caſt up the furrows with aſhovell, ſmooth the bed with the Rake, or make drills by lines in made up beds, ſow and cover the ſame with the Rake head, not diſordering the Ranks, or to ſet the ſingle ſeeds with ſticks by lines, or to ſow the bed, and then to ſilt fine mould thereon, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Sow the ſtrong and hardy deeper than the ſmall and tender, and ſow ebber at ſpring than before winter, and deeper in a light, than a ſtiff ſoil.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53203:39"/>
                     <p>Albeit I uſe for the moſt part to Plant and ſow every ſpecies by themſelves, yet you may ſometimes uſe mixtures, as Carrots and Radiſh in one bed, becauſe the Radiſh may be gone e're the Carrots require much Room. Among new ſet Liquoriſh ſow Onyons, Radiſh, Lettice, and you may ſow Radiſh, Lettice, Parſly, Carrats, Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeps together, gathering each in their ſeaſons, the Parſneeps will ſtay till winter. And drop Beat-Rave or parſly in your onyonbeds to ſtay winter after onyons ar gone. Alſo Beat-Rave, Skirrets, Beans, at conſiderable diſtance in the Intervalls of new Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Artichocks, alſo at a great diſtance among cabbages, or in the edge of the furrows of other beds.</p>
                     <p>The moſt naturall time for ſowing is, when the ſeeds of their own accord falls into the ground, nevertheleſs that many doth well at this ſeaſon, as ſtony ſeeds and ſuch as can endure winter, yet the tender which ar many with us, doth beſt in the ſpring, but for convenience we ſow at ſeverall other ſeaſons, as in ſummer, (at which time they require watering and ſhade) and in Autumne (which is the only ſeaſon for ſome) who if tender requires defence &amp; ſhelter; nor can we have others early at ſpring without hot beds, which is required in ſpeciall by ſuch as comes not to perfection in our ſhort Summer.</p>
                     <p>Endeavour to ſow when the ſoil is in good temper, a hot-furrow is good, but ſome grounds will not harrow or Rake when new delv'd or Plow'd, which when expoſed ſometime to air, Froſt, Sun, and Showres doth crumble and fall tender; hence ought ſuch to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by fallowing. See more particularly the manner and ſeaſon for each ſort in their reſpective Chapters following.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Suckers ar theſe which growes, Runs, Springs off, or about the mother-Plant, whereof is made off ſetts by ſevering or parting them off therefrom.</p>
                     <p>Take off theſe on Trees and ſhrubs with a violent but cleanly pull, be carefull of bulbo roots and Anemonies, that you wound not the mother-Plant.</p>
                     <p>To force ſuch as are unapt to put forth Suckers naturally, you

When the branches are grown, cut off this Plant to live by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Another way is to cut the Root through a little diſtance from the Tree, with a cleanly ſlop down-wards, and raiſe up the butt-end of the Root, ſo cut off till it be a little above the ſurface, as for Root graffing hereafter diſcribed, level in and trade the Earth again: ſo ſhall the piece left at the Tree ſend furth young Roots, and the Root ſo cut and raiſed ſend out a Top.</p>
                     <p>Better Earth for Bulbs and other Roots, will aſſiſt them to put forth Suckers.</p>
                     <p>Cutting the Tops of Fibrous Rooted-herbes, in growing-time will help them to off ſets, and to laſt long too.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon for ſevering off ſets of Hardie-trees that loſe the leaf, is latter end <hi>October</hi> and beginning <hi>November,</hi> albeit you may alſo any time till <hi>March,</hi> weather open.</p>
                     <p>Young Tender-trees, with Hardie-greens, let the winter froſt be over, and before the ſap riſe, <hi>April</hi> beſt for greens.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. To propagate by cuttings, is to cut off the branch or ſtem of a Plant, and to ſet it in the Earth without Roots.</p>
                     <p>Strip it of leaves and branches, Plant deeper than theſe with Roots, and in a rich and moiſt ſoil, keeping it watered and ſhaded, Untill Rooted; cut off their Tops ſave Greens, as if your cutting be 12 Inches long, let 9 be under, and 3 above ground.</p>
                     <p>The better to effect their Rooting, (if a hard ſubſtance, as Yew, Quince, &amp;c.) Twiſt there ends a little or cleave them a piece: If tender Plants of great Pith as Jaſmines, July-flowers, &amp;c. Cut only at a joynt or knot, and plant them: If large ſtems of Pithy Trees, as Poplars &amp;c. Sharp their ends down to a point, reſerving the bark whole on one ſide.</p>
                     <p>If ſtock July-flowers, ſlit the Bark near the end in ſeveral parts round the Stem, fold up the Bark ſo cut, and taking the peel'd part cloſe off, Plant the ſame with this Bark ſpread as you do a Root.</p>
                     <p>The time of planting cuttings is, (if Trees &amp; Shrubs,) a little before they Spring, and if Herbes, when ſpringing, as above for off-ſets: and let the Stems of July-flowers, and Wall-flowers be well ſhot <hi>i. e.</hi> ſomething firme, and take ſuch as has not had a Flower.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To increaſe by laying is to bend down ſome branch to the ground, and with a hooked ſtick thruſt into the ground, ſtay the ſame in its place, and cover with earth of deepneſs as you ſee fit: let the ſoil be good, watered and ſhaded in drought, and from ſcorching Sun ſheltered in Winter, if needfull.</p>
                     <p>To force their Rooting (if July-flowers) Prune off the under and withered leaves, and cut it at a joynt into the pith (<hi>i. e.</hi> half way through) and ſlit it up to the next joynt, thruſt down the cut part Gently into the ground, making it faſt, cover as before. If Trees and Shrubs, prick the rind full of holes at the place interred, or cut away the Bark round at the ſame place: but if the branch be ſmall, uſe it as July-flowers, and if any refuſe, ty them hard and faſt above the ſlit with a piece Pack-threed or Wyre, to ſtop the ſap in its courſe, that it may provide for Rooting. Cut off all their Tops as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53203:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>you lay them, except Greens and ſome very Pithy Trees.</p>
                     <p>The time for laying all Trees and Shrubs that loſe the leaf, is <hi>October,</hi> as alſo <hi>March,</hi> if ſecured from drought. All Greens in <hi>April,</hi> which therefore muſt be ſhaded. July flowers in <hi>March, April,</hi> or <hi>July.</hi>

Therefore faſten a Pot, Basket, old Hatt or the like on the Tree (by a ſtake or ſome ſupporter) let it have a hole in its bottome, through which you muſt put the branch to be propagated, and then fill the Pot with rich earth, (having ordered the branch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to cauſe it Root) and Water it often; willow earth or Rotten willow ſticks at the bottom of the Pot helps to retain the moiſtuer. I have effected this with clay and Cowes dung well mixt (after part of the Bark has been taken off round) clapt about with a double or triple ſwadling of Straw, or Hay Roaps.</p>
                     <p>This is a midſummer as well as Spring-work, and very notable for to propagate ſuch as can ſcarcely be otherwayes obtain'd.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Graffing is to take a cyon or twig of atree and place into another (call'd the ſtock) fit to receite the ſame that the inward Bark, or rind of Both may Joyn &amp; ſaps unite, &amp;c. Whereof there be ſeveral wayes, as,</p>
                     <p>Firſt of Graffing in the clift, ſaw off the head of the ſtock in a ſmooth place, about half a foot above ground, for Dwarffs and Wall-trees; as alſo for Standard, Aple, and Pear, (for they will ſhoot up for a body) but betwixt 3 and 4 foot for Standard-cherrie, and Plum. Pare ſmooth its head Ragled by the ſow, then cleave it a little beſide the pith, and with your Pen-knife cut away any jags, roughneſs, or blackneſs that remaines after cleaving on each ſide the clift within; then prepare the graff by cutting on both ſides
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53203:41"/>from ſome knot or bud in forme of a wedg ſuitable to the clift with little ſhoulderings, not Ragling the end: for if the bark be raiſed at the tail or lower end of the graff, (eſpecially the Cherrie) Impeds its growing, cut off its Top about 2 Inches above the ſhoulderings cloſe behind a leaf-bud; then open the clift with the Graffing Iron, ſet the graff (or two Graffs if the ſtock be great) in the clift, ſo as the inward part of the rind of the Graff may joyn exactly &amp; cloſe to the inward part of the Bark of the ſtock, and if it Pinch, as great ſtocks will, ty it not as you muſt do the ſmaller: or put in a little wedg Gently to keep it, take a Slice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark (from the cut-off head) and cut a hole therein, as it may ſlide on, &amp; joyn round the butt of the Graff, and cover the ſtock cloſe over in forme of a hawks hood, laſtly cover with clay tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Horſe-dung, that hath a little ſhort leitter in it, or with ſoft wax for ſmaller ſtoks: this is to preſerve it from cold &amp; drying-winds, and from wet which harms moſt.</p>
                     <p>Note, if the ſtock ſtand perpendicular, ſet the Graff on the Weſt-ſide: if not, then place it on the upperſide: if you fear winds ſupport them with ſticks as Splinters to a broken bone.</p>
                     <p>Unbind, when you find their bands harme them, towards midſummer, at which tyme top ſuch as has ſhot ſo large as to be in danger of breaking with the winds, eſpecially them Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in the Bark, hereafter diſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Pull up Suckers, cloſe and cleanly from the Roots: alſo Rub off buds that appear on the ſtock. Graffs cannot thrive or proſper, if the ſtoks be uncleanly or illthriving, and this is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd through bad training.</p>
                     <p>Another way of clift-Graffing is, to cleave the Graff and not the ſtock. Thus: prepare the ſtock and Graff as for ſhoulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (next diſcribed,) then with the Pen-knif, cleave the inward face of the Graff in the cut part, and cut up the ſtock with a ſlop, ſo that one lip of the clift-cyon may by bound on the one ſide of the ſtock, and the other longer lip on the outſide, as in ſhouldering.</p>
                     <p>The Grauff ſits here, as on a ſadle, with a leg on each ſide the ſtock,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53203:42"/>and therefore will better reſiſt the Winds; as alſo the wound cauſed by the clift, will ſoon recover. I have them wholly healed the ſame year, wherein I Graffed them.</p>
                     <p>Shouldering is to cut off the head of the ſtock, and ſmooth it, as at firſt; then cut the Graff from a knot, or bud on one ſide ſloping about ane Inch and half long, with a ſhoulder, but not deep, that it may reſt on the head of the ſtock. the Graff muſt be cut from the ſhoulder ſmooth and even, ſloping gradually, that the lower end be thin: place the ſhouldering on the head of the ſtock, and mark by the end of the cut part of the Graff, and cut away ſo much Bark of the ſtock as the Graff did cover; then place both together, that the cut parts of both may joyn and ſaps unite one on the other: bind them cloſe together with baſs, and hood them with clay tempered with dung or wax, as before.</p>
                     <p>Graffing in the Bark may be uſed in greater ſtocks, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing of old trees, and is only for aples; becauſe later in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, which may be the latter end <hi>April,</hi> when the Bark of the ſtock will peel: for when both ſtock and Graff is prepared, (as in ſhouldering) inſtead of cutting away ſome Bark of the ſtock; for receiving the Graff you muſt ſlit it on the South-ſide from the top allmoſt as long, as the ſloped part of the Graff, and looſen the Bark at the top of the ſlit with the point of the half round wedg, (made a purpoſe tapering down-wards to a point) which alſo thruſt down between the Bark and ſtock, to make room for the Graff; but firſt cut a little Bark at the thin end of the ſlope of the <hi>Cyon,</hi> that it double not in going doun, yet leave it with a ſharp edg; and becauſe when the <hi>Cyon</hi> is put in, it will bear the Bark hollow from the ſtock nick or ſlit, the Bark on each ſide the cyon, ſo that it may fall cloſe to the ſtock and to the edges of the cyon; then bind and cover, as before.</p>
                     <p>Graffing by approach, is good for theſe that holds not well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes: but herein the ſtocks muſt be placed ſo near the Tree, (where the graffs are) that the branch may reach it; then may you clift or ſhoulder-graff the twig you mean to propagate, into the ſtock; and as ſoon as graff and ſtock do unite and at incorporated together,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53203:42"/>cut off the cyon or graff underneath, cloſe to the graffed place, that it may ſubſiſt by the ſtock only.</p>
                     <p>Root-graffing is, to take the twig of any Tree you mean to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and a piece Root of the ſame kind (cut and Raiſed up a little as in ſect 4.) and graff them by ſhouldering, uniting the buttends of graff and Root, cauſing the rind of the Root Joyn to the rind of the graff, and ſo bind them: the next year they may be Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to nurſerie; theſe will be eaſily dwarffed, &amp; readily hold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that the defect of Stocks ar ſupplyed, and they fit for tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> There be many other wayes, but theſe nam'd ar the moſt material.</p>
                     <p>The time of graffing is, when the ſap beginnes to ſtirr in the ſpring; you muſt begin earlier with Cherries, Plumes, ſome later with Pears, ending with Aples.</p>
                     <p>Choiſe not your graffs from ſuch Trees as ar ill-Bearers, neither from ſuch as has not come to bear at all, but from conſtant and well bearing Trees, and the faireſt and fulleſt of buds thereon: let them have a piece of the precedent years ſhot, whereof make the tail and ſhouldering Immediatly below the butt of young wood; and if the ſtock be large, make the graffs wholly of the laſts years ſhot; and ſuch (having blowing buds actually upon them) I have ſeen bear fruit the ſame year. But ſome old bearing Trees yields no graffs: wherefore you may cut out ſome great branch, that it may ſhoot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, or rather take off the ſame branch by circumpoſition and plant; the which new Tree may furniſh you with graffs. Cut your graffs e're they ſprout, and keep them or carry them, their ends in clay, or dry in a box, their tops cut off.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Inoculation, differs from the former wayes of graffing, and moſt proper for Apricoks and peaches: any ſort will more readily hold by this than by graffing, except Cherries; they come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a Tree: for I had a plum ſhoot above 6 foot, 10 Inches the firſt year; and thô they miſs, yet the ſtock is not the worſe. Therefore.</p>

                     <p>In ſome convenient and ſmooth part of the ſtock (at the ſame hight as for graffing) with the penknife cut the rind overthwart, and from the midle thereof gently ſlit the bark about an Inch long in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of. <hi>a T,</hi> not wounding the ſtock; then nimbly prepare the bud by cutting off the leaf till a little of the tail, then ſlit the bark, on each ſide a little diſtance from the bud, and about half Inch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and below the ſame, ſharp that end below that it may the more eaſily go down, and having a quill, cut more than half away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Inch long at the end, (for dividing the bud and rind from the ſtalk) therewith take it off dextrouſly and leave not the Root be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: for if you ſee a hole under the bud on the inſide, the Root is gone, caſt it away and prepare another. when the bud is ready, then with a bone (made half round and ſharp at the point tapering on the one ſide) raiſe the bark or rind on each ſide the ſlit carefully, not hurting the inner rind, and with care put in the bud, thruſting it down till its top Joyn with the croſs cut: then bind it cloſe above and below the bud with dry'd Ruſhes or baſs. Or,</p>
                     <p>You may ſlit the bark of the ſtock upwards from the croſs cut. Or,</p>
                     <p>Cut the edges of the bark about the bud oblong ſquair, and the bark of the ſtock fit to receive the ſame. Or</p>
                     <p>Reſerve ¼ of this ſquair piece bark of the ſtock untaken off at the upper end, which muſt be raiſed, that the ſhild may ſlide up betwixt the ſame and the ſtock; and ſo bind gently, as before.</p>
                     <p>The time for Inoculation is, when the ſap is moſt in the ſtock, namely from <hi>June</hi> till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> neer a moneth after unbind <hi>i. e.</hi> cut through binding and bark with a gentle ſlit on the back ſide of the ſtock, leaving the binding to fall away of its own accords: at which time you will ſee who holds.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How to Cultivate, and prepare grounds.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. HAving ſhew'd the ſeveral wayes of propagating plants, it is alſo moſt requiſite that you prepare the ground for effectuating the ſame. And that is in the firſt place,</p>
                     <p>To trench it, <hi>viz.</hi> Begin at one end of the ground, (you mean thus to culture and open) a trench from one ſide to the other, thereof 3 or 4 foot broad, and from one to two foot deep, as the qualitly of the ground admits and plants require (therefore li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh muſt have deeper,) this being open, meaſure off other 4 foot parallel at its ſide, turne that into the open trench, with the turf or ſurface in the bottome, and the clean earth on the top; the filling whereof emptieth an other, therefore cut off other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer foot and turne that in as before; thus trench by trench till the whole be finſhed. I preſume you carryed the earth of the firſt trench to fill the laſt, or otherwayes filled hollowes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and left the laſt trench open, (if convenient) for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving weeds. Or if the ground be hollow in the midle begin there, and trench both wayes to help the level; if high in the midle, begin at both ſides or ends till the two open trenches meet at the hight, for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The latter end of harveſt the ground is ſofteſt for trenching, and it lying all Winter open to the weather is thereby meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For as trenching doth well prepare hard, barren, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toil'd ground, ſe doth it ſuch as is exhauſted by long and unſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilfull uſage. and if at every trenching you apply proper manures mixt with the ſecond ſpading, or under the laſt ſhovelling, and in 5 years retrench, it will become to your wiſh, for all gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and plantations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next excellent way of preparing ground, is fallowing; begin as ſoon as you reap the crop, but let the ground be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53203:44"/>moiſt, albeit you ſhould ſtay for a ſhowre, if this be not late in Autumne, you may fallow in <hi>November:</hi> eſpecially if ſtiff ground and reſtirre in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> when you plant or ſow; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit you ſhould neither plant or ſow it that year, keep it clean of weeds in ſummer by hawing, &amp;c. and at Autumne fallow again. but as in trenching ſo in this work you ſhould mix with proper ſoil.</p>
                     <p>Make uſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhion of ſpades which are now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and let every two delvers, have a ſhoveller to caſt up the ſmall that falls in bottom of the furrow, and the Delvers ſhould turne up the point of the ſpade, and nimbly break and chop all the clods throughly; this is very material as well as the through mixing of the manures with the ſoil: So that mixing, ſtirring, reſtirring, fallowing is moſt pertinent for the cold, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, barren Rugged-natur'd-ground in <hi>Scotland</hi> all which ſoftens and tenders it, and ſo fits it for nouriſhing good ſeed and plants, as I can tell by experience, therefore.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I adviſe our Husband-men alſo to the fallowing of their land, as one; flitfolding the ſame, as a ſecond; Watering, or overflowing land, as a thrid, burning the Turf as a fourth, draining exceſſive moiſture, as a fifth; applying proper ſoils and manures, and that at proper ſeaſons, as a ſixt; laying the land to reſt, as a ſeventh; and above all, incloſing and planting about their land, as the laſt, and beſt improvement.</p>
                     <p>Example: At the Autumnal fallowing, delve, or Plow deep, and apply hot unrotted and uncompound dungs and manures: at ſpring re-plow or re-delve, and apply ſuch dungs and manures as has layn mixed and rotted with Earth; then Mix, Rake, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The ſummer following is to deſtroy the weeds, and may be done by Turf, Plough or by hawing.</p>
                     <p>The Huſhbandmens flitfolding is equivalent to Gard'ners co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, eſpecially of dry and barren ground with leitter, &amp;c. The dung and urine of Sheep and cattle waſhes evenly into ground, and ſhould be turned down by the ſummer,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53203:45"/>and Autumnal fallowing, leſt its ſubſtance exhauſt by Sun and Air, (except that for graſs, then only harrowed with a buſh of thorns) inſtead whereof Gard'ners ſhould top their coverings of leitter with a little Earth or Sand, and at Autumne delve all down together.</p>
                     <p>Husbandmens watering is by Running Plough-furrowes (and trenches where needful) alongſt or croſs their land, ſo as the water may gently ſweem over the whole: this in the Winter, on dry and barren grounds, which leaves Sulphureous pingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity behind it, and ſtrongly improves either for graſs or corn; but that this Husbandry ought as well to be practiſed on wet grounds, is evident, that the Running of this carryes away the ſowr qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the other.

                     <p>Burning land is, to pare its ſurface with the Turf Plough and lay the ſame in heaps to burn; and ſo ſpreads the aſhes: but if moſs and heath, ſet fire through, without turfing it; this deſtroyes the noxious ſowr nature and the ſalt remains in the aſhes, for the ſtrengthening the Spirit of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Draining the wet, bogie or dropſical ground is, by trenches a little deeper than the Spring, (how deep ſoever) and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply lyme, ſoot, aſhes, pigeons dung, &amp;c As for the abounding of ſuperficial water, that is eaſily helped by common waterſowers, or in ſome grounds by ſinking holes down to the channel.</p>
                     <p>As the Husbandman ſhould have his land layed out or divided into ſeveral cloſes, ſome for corn, ſome for medow, and others for paſture: ſo when he has taken 5, 6, or 7 crops of corn, he ſhould lay it out for paſture, otherwayes it will wear out of heart; and likwayes the paſture muſt be plowed up for corn, eſpecially when it beginnes to grow moſſie.</p>
                     <p>The way that the Gard'ner turns his ground to reſt, is by trenching and retrenching, whereby it can never wear out: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he alſo obſerves to change the crops as well as the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Among all the Varieties of ſoils, that next the ſurface of them is beſt, becauſe prepared by the Influence of Sun and Showers,</p>
                     <p>That called a loam or light brick Earth is the moſt natural ground for gardens and plantations; ſtrong Blew, White, or Reid clayes are worſt: but the nearer they be to a mixture of loam (or if they have ſtones naturally in them) they ar the better; alſo, the nearer gravelly or ſandy grounds incline to loam, ſo much the better. therefore if your ground be ſtiff, trench with ferns, ſtraw, bean-ham, thatch, leitter, Earth under woodſtacks, ſmall ſticks, &amp;c. If gravelly or ſandy, then trench and mix with loam or the upper part of clay, the Turf of both is good.</p>
                     <p>If ſtrong clay, trench and mix with fat ſand, highway Earth that hath drift ſand in it, Rubiſh of buildings, Lime-Rubiſh, gravel. And if it be for gardens or orchards, enrich it with dungs mixt with drift-ſand or light mouldheaped up <hi>ſtratum ſuperſtratum i. e.</hi> laying by laying. And if the ground be cold, the more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and poultrie dung you put in it, the lighter and warmer it will be. Or make <hi>Stratums</hi> of Earth, dung and unſlaked lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to ly a year, and then apply this compoſition, which has been hitherto a great ſecret: therefore prize it.</p>
                     <p>Binding grounds, which will not Rake as you delve, if dry and hard, trenching and fallowing expoſeth them to be ſoftned by weather, as is ſaid: But if wet and tough, mix with Aſhes, ſea-Sand, &amp;c. In Culturing.</p>
                     <p>For preparing my compoſts, I uſe a pit (wherein ſomtimes I make a hot-bed) oblong, about 4 foot deep of length and breadth, as I can get dungs, Vegetables, and ſoils to fill it: here to lay all Kindes or ſorts with <hi>Stratums</hi> of Earth, as horſe, neat, Sheep, Pigeons, and Poultrie dung, ferns, weeds, leaves, ſoot, aſhes, ſticks, ſaw-duſt, feathers, hair, horns, bones, urine, ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of pondes, ditches, blood, pickle, brine, ſea-water, the the cleanſing of Houſe of Office, &amp;c. Let them ly a year at leaſt,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53203:46"/>but not above two: then take them out and there Stirre, Air, mingle and work them with freſh Earth or by themſelves, as you have occaſion, till they become ſweet and of an agreable ſcent; (yet retaining their vertue) this frees them from the noxious qualities they otherwayes retaine, and conſequently not ſo apt to gender or produce Worms, Weeds, and Muſhroms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wholſome and pleaſant plants, fruits, and Roots for the table.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Obſerve what manures are proper for the ſoil, as, all hot-dungs and manures are proper for cold, ſtiff, and moiſt grounds: ſo all rotten and cold dungs and manures are proper for dry and hot gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unds. All manures that retaines moiſture are for poor, Sandy and Gravelly ſoils</p>
                     <p>As, Horſe-dung for ſtiff and cold ground; Sheeps for hot and dry; Aſhes for cold, ſtiff and moiſt; old Woolen-rags for poor dry; Lyme moſt excellent for mooriſh and heatly land; Hair of Beaſts for dry and ſtiff grounds; pigeons and poultrie dung for cold and moiſt; Rotten ſaw duſt for dry; Rubiſh of buildings for ſtiff, cold grounds; Salt for cold and moiſt; uſe it moderately, it deſtroyes vegetables on dry ground, eſpecially at firſt, but when melted by Winter Raines, it fertilizeth: Some has ſowen it on moiſt, mooriſh land to great advantage, for being farr from the Sun we have little volatile.</p>

                     <p>Let not the Root of any Tree ſtand on dung, farr leſs unrotten dung which burns them; but upon prepared and proper ſoil, and compoſed, well mixed, aired, ſtirred or fallowed. Moſt fit is the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of ſtreets and highwayes together, with the mud and ſcouring of pondes and ditches, if firſt layed on heaps in the open Air to rott and ſweeten, and if you mix it with ſtratums of Lyme that adds much to its goodneſs and fertility.</p>

                     <p>Forreſt-trees require not ſo much dung as Fruit-trees, but well mixed and fallowed ſoil.</p>
                     <p>Kitchen Herbes and Roots requires very fat, light, warme and well cultured ground.</p>
                     <p>Flowers and fine plants cannot endure ſoil too rank with dung, neither can they proſper if it be poor; but freſh, clean Earth with rotted neats dung well beaten and mixed together, and a little rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten willow Earth a little below the Roots: here comes in that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſoil, the Turf of the paſture mixt with a little Lyme, Cowes and Sheeps dung, well rotted and mingled as before.

                     <p n="7">7. As for making the hot-bed for raiſing early and tender plants, dig a pit (4 foot deep, and of length and breadth, as you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) in a convenient and warme place, lying well to the Sun and ſheltered from winds (which you may help by art, if not ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) fill it with dung and leitter from the Stables, about a ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thnights gathering, (ſome makes it of Barley-ſtraw, or the ſame mixt with bran, becauſe it keeps heat long, and its heat not ſo exceſſive nor ſo noiſome to plants as dung) and when well Tread, and even on the Top, lay about 4 Inches thick of rich, light (but freſh and clean) ſifted mould thereon: arch it over with ſticks, and cover with matts 4 or 5 dayes to cauſe it heat, then uncover and give it Air a day or two, that its violent heat may paſs; then ſow your ſeeds, and cover the bed again And the next day if you find the bed over hot give it more Air, if too cold caſt ſome Straw on the covering untill the heat returne; ſo by airing and covering you may keep it in a conſtant temper: when the Seeds come up, give them Air to dry the moiſture raiſed by the heat of the bed. How to cover the choice with Glaſſes, ſee Chap. 6. Sect, 1. But as there is great trouble in rightly ordering this ſort of hot-bed; ſo here remedied by a better, which is only to fill and tread the pit full of new dung and leitter, (not covering it with Earth) and place wooden caſes therein, about 9 or 10 Inches deep and about 3 foot broad, (having wood-handles
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53203:47"/>at the ends) boar them full of Auger or Wimble holes at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, fill them with the foreſaid earth; and therein ſow your ſeeds: and theſe caſes and the earth in them will be kept warme during the whole ſeaſon, wherein a hot-bed is neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if it loſe heat add freſh dung and leitter under, about and betwixt the caſes; (there is Dew on the Glaſſes, while the heat remains, but if exhauſted, they will be dry) conſequently the trouble of tranſplanting from one hot bed to another is hereby ſaved. Provide a ſhelter over the whole, if you pleaſe, and frames of Glaſs over ſome of the inſide caſes, where there is moſt need; others you may leave open, as your Seeds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. By this your pit and caſes are every year ready to your hand, requiring only a ſupply of freſh dung. But this pit will be ſo much the more excellent, if lyn'd round at the ſides with brick: and where you cannot conveniently ſink it for Water, you may build the ſame above ground. And when this pit is empty it will be alſo ready for wintering of Flower Pots with <hi>July-flowers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In watering plants, uſe not well-water, eſpecially for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plants, neither Rivers that run long and quick on ſharp gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: theſe yields no nouriſhment to plants, but rather chills them; therefore if you muſt uſe ſuch, let them ſtand ſometime in the Sun and open Air, uncovered in tubs, mixt with dung, and powr it off the dreg when you uſe it. let the quantity and quality of the dung be according to the nature of your plants (as if great growers and require much heat, put horſe or pigeons dung into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but for the more durable put Sheeps dung) remembering if your ground be bad, to add the more dung.</p>
                     <p>When dung lyes above ground about any plants, (as I uſe to do with Trees, Artichocks, &amp;c.) The water deſcending through the ſame is very reliſhing to the Roots, if you powr the water at a little diſtance round the Tree: for when laſhed on the ſtem, it waſheth the Earth from the Roots.</p>
                     <p>Water no plants with ſtanding, ſtinking Ditch-water, nor no Water that ſtinketh: Rain-water and large Ponde-water is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but keep it not too long; yet if in a large Veſſel, the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53203:47"/>oftener you Stir it, the longer it will keep ſweet: ſo the larger your pondes or Rivers be, and the opener to the Sun and Air, and the more moving by horſe, geeſe and ducks their Sweeming, the ſweeter it will be. and if the waſhings of ſtables, ſtreets, dung Hill-water, &amp;c. Run into them, that adds much to their fertility, providing they have ſome moving, as is ſaid, to make them ſweet.</p>
                     <p>If you fear dry weather differre not too long, but water whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le your ground is yet moiſt; differre not, if you mind to water at all. theſe that Root deepeſt, water moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo when you do begin, Continue it ſo long, as you find occaſion. In watering Trees and greater Plants, ſtir and waken the Earth a little about their Roots with a fork, ſo as it may drink the more evenlier, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to tread firme again. And for the ſame cauſe you may ſink the Earth a little in forme of a ſhallow diſh rownd your Coleflowers, Artichocks, &amp;c. Dip your Flower Pots in a Tub of water, to drink through the holes at the bottome.</p>
                     <p>When you water beds of ſmall ſeeds with the watering pot, ſhake it nimbly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may fall like a ſhowre of ſmal Rain. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve often made uſe of a handful of ſmall Straw or Hay drawen as thatch, tyed in the midle, and at one end powred water with a Cup, and ſhaked the ſame that it appeared like a Gentle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewing rather than a glutting Rain.</p>
                     <p>Some that are deſirous to have the ground allwayes moiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any plant, do place near it a veſſel with water, and in it a piece woollen clothe with one end thereof hanging out to the ground, and the other in the water: the Cloath being firſt wet, it will drop continually, if the end without be lower than that within the veſſell: and when the water within fails, it may be augmented; If it drop not faſt enough, the clothe may be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if too faſt, diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Early in the Spring while the weather is yet cold, I intreat you be cautious in watering the leaves of the young and tender plants, only wet the ground about them when your plants or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53203:48"/>ſeeds are more hardy and the nights yet cold, water in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons: but when the nights are warme, or dayes very hot, then the evening is the beſt time.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. OMmiting here the diſtinction of ſpecies, (having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to one chapter) I ſhall ſpeak briefly, yet I hope plainly of their Governement, thus:</p>
                     <p>Albeit the moſt of Forreſt-trees may be Increaſed by Suckers, Layers, &amp;c. Yet if you deſire Trees worth your while, Raiſe them from the ſeed. Therefore prepare a ſeminary or ſeed-plot together with a nurſerie well ordered and handſomely made up in beds, as in part 1. Chap. 5. ſect. 2. and there ſow and ſet your ſeeds and plants in their reſpective ſeaſons; keep them clean from weeds, and water them when need is: alſo Earth up and dible in theſe caſt up by the Froſts, as well as ſhade and ſhelter in time of neceſſity. Let them ſtand ſome but one, others two years in the ſeminary after they riſe, then remove and plant in nurſerie, a foot one way and half the other diſtance, or 5 Rowes in the bed (if 6 foot broad,) in ſtraight lines, having firſt prun'd their Roots, eſpecially toped the main Root that runs ſtraight down; ſo ſhall they ſend furth ſyde or ſeeding Roots, and agree well with tranſplanting thereafter. Alſo proportion the head to the Root by pruning up the ſide boughes, reſerving ſome ſmalleſt afterwards all the way on the body, to ſtop the ſap in its courſe, that the Tree may grow great with its hight, and this will prove the beſt fortification againſt the winds.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53203:48"/>
                     <p>Cut not the tops of theſe Trees you ordain for Timber, except ſome grow crooked in the nurſerie; theſe ſave Greens may be fell'd near ground in the Spring or at midſummer, and train up the ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhoot again to be the Tree. When they have ſtood 3 years at moſt in this nurſerie, replant them at a wider diſtance in Spad-bit trenches, 3 foot one way and two the other, where they may ſtand till they be ready for planting out in your Avenues, Parks, Groves, &amp;c. Which will be in 3 years, if thir Rules be obſerved. But if you think them yet too ſmall for ſetting out, you muſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant at a wider diſtance, and at every remooval Top all their Roots with a ſharp Knife, and thin the ſide-boughes for lightning the head: but do not prune up all, as is the Cuſtome of the ignorants, whoſe Trees are ſo long, ſmall and top-heavy, that they cannot ſtand; but of pruning more hereafter. If you neglect this tranſplanting and pruning the top Root, while young, your eſſayes to do it when old will prove ineffectual, nor will they ever be worth the while.</p>
                     <p>All the time that your Trees remains in nurſerie, and at leaſt the firſt and ſecond year thereafter, be carefull to cleanſe them from Weeds and Suckers by delving, hawing, &amp;c. The advantage here ſhall ſoon counter-ballance the coſt.</p>
                     <p>Choice your Seeds from the high, ſtreight, young and well thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Trees; and the faireſt, weyghtieſt, and brighteſt thereon: for its obſerved that the ſeeds of hollow Trees (<hi>i. e.</hi> Trees whoſe pith is conſum'd) doth not fill well or come to perfection, as <hi>Langford</hi> ſayes of Pears, concluding that the Kirnells of Fruit depend much upon the pith. And I bid you reject ſuch as was never ſet by art, as Peeviſh parents for Children, that muſt be thus accommodat with uncouth lodgings as well as dyets in their travells: Its a miſchief in many people that accompts all ridiculous, that they have not been bred up with or accuſtom'd unto, ſo with Trees in ſome reſpect.</p>

                     <p>The great Maple, commonly, but falſly called Plan. its feed is ripe in <hi>September:</hi> ſow it at Spring it, comes up that ſeaſon: affects a ſoil with Aſh or rather better.</p>

                     <p>The Beach ſeed ripes the end of ſept: but it fills not well every year, nor at we ſo very plentiful of old trees, as could be wiſhed: for that caufe we fend abroad for ſeed. as ſoon as it comes to our hand, it may be ſowen, or rather keept in a couch of ſand, as the great Maple till the ſpring, for it comes up that ſeaſon: affects a light ſoil, no clayes.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. In Tranſplanting remove with earth about their Roots (if you can) eſpecially greens, at leaſt take all the Roots up a good diſtance from the ſtem, by making a Trench round, and be not haſtie: then top all their Roots with a ſharpe knife, (ſlop tending down as a horſe foot) cut off all the bruiſed and broken parts till you
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53203:51"/>come at firme wood, top the ſmall Roots like hair, to make them ſtiff, ſo as they fold not, when the Earth is put in, and rott there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: proportion the head alſo to the Root by thinning it, prune fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boughs; (reſerving allvayes ſome for tapering the Tree) theſe you cut, do it cloſe and ſmooth by the body, ſlanting upwards, and they will ſoon overgrow the wounds, if the branch cut off be not great. Cut not the tops of <hi>Oaks, Beaches</hi> they cannot endure it, neither any Tree that you ordain for timber; albeit I have been neceſſitate to lop great old Trees, whoſe heads could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be conform'd to their Roots, which neceſſarly ardimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon removal. But this is not the caſe of well trained Trees in anurſerie.</p>
                     <p>The Rule for removing old large Trees out of woods or other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who was never before Tranſplanted, is to make a trench at two ſides of the Tree, diſtance conſiderable, till you can Inforce the Tree upon on ſide: then cut the top Root through, ſaving as many col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Roots as you can; leſſen its head, or lop it if it can ſuffer, and ſo ſet up the Tree again, and tread in the earth about it, as it was; let it ſtand 2 years to emitt fibres or feeding Roots to nurſe it when Planted out.</p>
                     <p>But to my nurſed trees again. When you remove, as is directed, carry them as quickly to their new quarters as you can; let the ſoil where you ſet them be as <hi>Connatural</hi> to the nurſerie as noſſible, ſee the laſt <hi>chap,</hi> for preparing grounds and ſee part 1.<hi>chap.</hi> 3, and 4. for the orderlie wayes of planting.</p>
                     <p>The beſt way is to make the holes a year before you plant, and in ſummer ſtirr and tune their earth, that no weeds grow thereon: make them betwixt, 12. and 18. Inches deep, and betwixt 4, and 8. foot diameter, if ordinarie trees: but if the ground be bad and not proper for the trees, then trench, mix &amp; apply, till ſuch become more agreeable.</p>
                     <p>When you plant, lay the ſurface in the bottome and fill up the hole with fine earth, till it can only admit the upper part of the root to ſtand level with the ſurface, (this is not to plant deep, for they that do;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53203:51"/>but cheat themſelves) then ſet on the Root of the tree in the midle of the hole, and if no earth adhere to the ſame, make a little hut in the middle of ſmall earth, and lay the roots right ſpread round about with your hands that nonly folded or diſorderly, then put in fine ſmall earth amongſt the roots, &amp; ſhake and move the tree, ſo that the earth may go in amongſt them till no cavity or void be left to let in the air; ſuch roots as folds raiſe up and level in their wonted poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with your hands ſhovelling on more earth and tread gently, then fill one more and tread well with your heels till it be as farr filled up about as it flood in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, make the bulk about level on the top, and juſt the breadth of the hole, and it will be about half a foot above the ſurface if ordinary nurſſed trees and good ground, you may put on the rounding ſtring to make its edges circular and handſome, or if you will to make it like a geometrical ſquair, then ſtreight lines from ſide to ſide of a thicket will make up the bulks that the whole will appear as walks and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours two wayes: lay new horſe dung and leitter or ferns above the bulk (ſo as it touch not the ſtem) covered with a little earth to keep it from drying, the Rains will waſh in its ſubſtance and refreſh the Roots, beſides it keeps out ſummer drough and winter frofts.</p>
                     <p>The firſt year at leaft go through, now and then, and tread them right after winds. I am not ſor ſlaking trees (but for training them ſo as they may not need it, except you drive three ſtakes about each tree at the out ſide of the bulk, then the double ſtraw Roaps tyed from its body to all the three ſtakes will ſecure; and if you faſten croſs ſticks briers and thorns, here ſhall be a fence about each tree. Rub off buds that offer to break foorth near the Root or any place where you would not have them, (but ſtill leave ſome here and there on the ſide to ſtop the ſap from running too much in head) keep them clean of ſuckers &amp; weeds by hawing in ſummer, &amp; delving &amp; looſening the mould about them ſpring and Autumne <hi>i. e.</hi> at the two equinoxi alls, and tread faſt again, as fearing drought and winds.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving is what is ſaid, you may expect monumental, clean and well thriving trees, if right prun'd and well Incloſed.</p>

Sect. 4. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect not your time of early planting, that is, as ſoon as they give over growing, and before the froſts come on, and you ſhall fee them farr out-ſtrip theſe ſet in the Spring, though have often planted in the Spring through neceſſity, but then I was allwayes ſomething more than ordinary carefull to defend them from the enſuing droughts, by covering their bulks and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, &amp;c. Yet I preferre the Spring for Firr, and other ſuch Greens, which therefore unavoidably requires the ſame care.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I ſhewed before how to prune in the nurſerie while young now continue, when planted out whileſt they be ſmall, prune every year, when a little older once in 2 years, then once in 3 or 4. and never ſeldomer than in 5 or 6.</p>
                     <p>And as you prune up the body, till the deſired hight leave ſmall branches here and there by the way, that it may bring greatneſs with its hight, and be by conſequence the more able to ſtand; let never a Tree get a greater head than its Root is ſufficiently able to nurſe and bear; neither be Raſh in loping them, except, they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready top-heavy, which brings crookedneſs; if ſo, cut at a crooked place, ſlanting upwards, clean and ſmooth, and train up the ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhoot again to be the Tree: or rather if you can ſave its head by thinning and croping the branches on that ſide which leans <hi>i. e.</hi> the underſide, thus at midſummer, and flit the Bark in the Spring, ſo may it grow ſtreight and taper. Purge ſtill the head when need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and prune ſuperfluities, cut off all that Croſs, Rubs, Frets, and Galls on another. Permit not Trees to Fork, train them with one ſtreight and taper body, and a handſome round Pyramidall head. And when you prune, cut cloſe and ſmooth by the body or bough with the Knife, or Chiſſell and Mell, or if the branch be great, cut with a ſaw (nicking it underneath firſt) and ſmooth it with the Chiſſell, ſo will it the better heal: but if the Tree be very old and the branches great, ſuch will never be able to overgrow the wound, therefore if you muſt cut ſuch, do at a little diſtance from the body, the wound declining the Horizon. Thus Train pines, Firrs, Pitch, and theſe of the Conicall Tribe in ſtories only (which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53203:52"/>methode they naturally follow,) you may cut out ſome of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt branches of the under ſtorie, but ſo as you leave them regular or equally furniſhed round: ſo may you leave one ſtorie, cut out the ſecond, leave the thrid, &amp;c. Cut not their tops, yet you may crop ſome of their ſide-boughes if the Tree be top-heavy, and afterwards as the Tree gets footing, cut theſe clean off.</p>
                     <p>There be two ſeaſons for pruning ſuch as loſe the leaf: the firſt for theſe of little pith is <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> or any time in Winter: and for them of ſoft wood and great hearts, and for Greens let the froſts be over, and before the ſap in them riſe, except Firrs and other Roſinious Trees in <hi>November,</hi> becauſe if prun'd in March they bleed, and in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> they have not given over growing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond time is midſummer, which is ordinarly about the end of <hi>June:</hi> this is a ſafe time to prun them of great pith and any that is unapt to bleed; but eſpecially for cutting of young ſhoots of this year: extripate all ſuch buds and ſhoots as you deſire not to grow, and hereby you may make clean bodied Trees, albeit never ſo apt to break out in Side-boughes, as ſome Elms are. for the diſeaſes of all Trees with their cures, ſee Chap. 5.

                     <p n="1">1. AS there is no Countrey can have more need of planting than this, ſo non more needfull of Incloſing: for we well know how vain it is to plant unleſs we Incloſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſpoke of Brick and Stone Walls, in Part.1 Chap. 5. Sect. 5. Now for Hedges I preferre the Holly and Hautkorn, raffed from the ſeed, albeit there be ſeveral others, mix, not Hedges, becauſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53203:53"/>ſtrong-growers over-growes the weak, neither fuſſer Briers, Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Docks, or Thiſſels therein.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Your <hi>hollies</hi> having flood two years in the ſeminary and two in the nurſerie, remove them by atrowall or a ſpade with a clod of Earth at their Roots, croping ſuch Roots as appears Without the clod with a ſharp Knife, and leſſen its head by croping the ſide-boughes, (cut not its top) plant in made up bordures, or at the back of Ditches at afoot diſtance in good earth. Let them ſtand two years untouched except weeded, then cut their tops at a bud to make them furniſh thick, and ply their ſide boughes to grow through other, like ſlicing or feathering, and next year fall to work with the Sheers, cutting both fides and top as we uſe to do with Box, &amp;c. Never ſupporting or binding any Hedg, as is the Cuſtome of ſome: plant your <hi>hollies</hi> in.<hi>Aprile,</hi> and when ready for ſheers, cut in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>July</hi> therewith, and ſo. train them cloſe from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but neither too broack nor too high.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>hawthorn</hi> having, ſood 2 or 3 years in the ſeminary, pull them up and cut the ends of their Roots, and their tops within 4 Inches of the Root, and plant them within the fence or back of the ditches in the good earth, delve them in ſpading by ſpading all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt two rowes, a foot diſtance, ſtanding in equilateral Triangles, ſtill thickning your bordure by adding good Earth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let them ſtand 3 years untouched, except weeding and reparing where any is dead; then fill them within half a foot of the ground, ſo will they ſhoot furth a thicket of young ſhoots, which next year may be train'd with the ſheers, as before is inſtructed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you would Plant your hedge on the face of a ditch, as in wet and tough grounds, then ſtreatch a line at both ſides of the intended ditch, and ritt with the ſpade alongſt by the ſame, ſlanting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for if the ditch be 7 quarters wide; it muſt; be 5 deep (ſloping to a foot in breadth at the bottom) then cut the turf or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of your ditch, and lay a gang or row of the firſt ſpading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt by the brink of the ditch (ſloping at the face according to the flop determin'd, with half a foot of table intercepting, becauſe ſo
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53203:53"/>much will crumble doun by the froſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) On the top of that, lay one row of quicks, their tops ſtanding up a little towards the ditch, cover their Roots with fine ſmall earth, and lay another ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding above them, and if you will lay another row of quicks above that, every one here oppoſing the mid-intervall of the other, and ſo cover on the reſt of the mould till the ditch be finiſhed: being all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waves ſure to put good earth next the quicks, thô you ſhould bring it from ſome high-way or ridg of land next thereunto, and every year ſcour the ditches, claping it up about the quicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a farr bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way is,</p>
                     <p>To caſt half of the Earth that comes out of the ditches, to each hand, and quicks in both ſides; accordingly this will make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible fence: for then the hedg growes up on both ſides of the ditch, the gutter betwixt makes it terrible, but that I am againſt the common double, (which is 2 ditches near other, and the Earth that comes out of both laid betwixt them, with arow of quicks in the face of each ditch,) is becauſe here the quicks are obnoxious to the croping of cattle; (beſides they take much ground and the quicks are too much burthened with Earth,) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you be for ſuch, make a little ſpace betwixt of plain ground, where you may plant the Hedg.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But if you would have a vow of Trees round by your dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, then make theſe two ditches the breadth of a walk ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, but parallel, and in that mid intervall plant one ſingle row of Trees, and the two hedges at the Back of the ditches: here you have two excellent walks of ſhade, nor is the ground loſt between thir hedges; you may have good Hay, and in large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. And in effect: this is the beſd way that ever I thought upon, for Incloſing and ſheltering our grounds and plantations; and you may make the Intervall betwixt these hedges wider, ſo as you may have two rowes of Trees.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now for fencing the quicks in all the ſeveral ſorts from the croping of beaſt, as indiſpenſibly neceſſary while young.</p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53203:54"/>
                     <p>If the Hedg be planted alonght by the back or inſide of the Ditch, then the ſtreng Ditch with its Earth eaſten to both ſides will ſence it: and if you think that not ſufficient, ſet, ſtake, and raiſe Hedg on the top of the bank, or rather (which is indeed much better,) cuttings of Thorns ſet there in a ſpade bit trench well backed: or for want of theſe, back up the Ditch with Turf, which is like half Ditching. But all this time there is but one ſide of them fenced, and that next the paſture; therefore no beaſts can come on the other ſide to eat the Fogage, except teathered horſes: but if you make the hedg or Hedges and Trees betwixt the two Ditches (you may caſt half of their Earth to each hand, and back them as is Said, which fences from all hands moſt elegantly. And if you plant your Hedges in the face of the Ditches, the ſame backing on each hand will alſo, fence them.</p>
                     <p>But where you plant Trees at a great diſtance through your fields or parks, you may fence every particular Tree by cutting a little trench round 4 foot off the Tree, and about 2 foot wide, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it handſomly up like a ditch, laying one row of Turfs or ſpadings above other, till it be 3 foot high from the ſurface, backing them with the small Earth or ſhovellings, battering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Tree; here the Tree muſt be high planted: tho more the Soyl inclyn to wet, or the ſourer that be, plant ſo much the higher above the ſurface; you may ſtick ſome Briers, or Thorns on the top of this Tump.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How to propagate, and order Fruit-trees.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THE only Fruits for this Countrey are Aples, Pears, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Plumes, (and Apricocks, and peaches at South-ſide of walls,) Currans, Goosberries, Rasberries, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Before I begin, I ſhall premiſe ſome obſervations on Graſſing, &amp;c. a ſure means to obtain Fruits of the deſired ſpecies, and that in ſhort time: for by taking the twig or bud of ſuch a ſort as is a good fruit, and bears well, and Graff or Inoculate into a proper ſtock, you ar ſure to have the ſame fruit; becauſe the Graff domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nires, albeit it may have a little ſmack of its ſtock whereon now Graffed. And you may expect fruit, becauſe it may actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have the fruit buds, as being taken from a bearing tree. But if you ſow the ſeed, they will be long e're they come to bear, and at length perhaps bring no fine fruit, and for the ſeed of Graffed Trees, they will not bring the ſame fruit; Peats, and Aples will rather bring a Fruit of the nature of the ſtock, whereupon they have been graffed; and although you ſhould take a Cyon of the ſame, and graff in its ſelf, that will not alter the Fruit, nor better the Tree, except a little check its aſpiring, which may as well be effected by pruning.</p>
                     <p>Wee can alſo be ſure of the desired fruit, by cuttings, layings, and circumpoſirion; but ſuch are allwayes Dwarfish and ſhort li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Trees, as wanting a main Root which all ſeedlings have. Hence ariſeth one reaſon, why ſtocks ſhould be raiſed from the ſeed Suckers are not ſo clean and luſtie; therefore not ſo able to nurſe the graffs, and they are apt to ſend Suckers again. Only I look upon plum Suckers as very good, becauſe when they Spring off a Root at a diſtance from the ſtem, they ſtrick good Root of themſelves, very much reſembling ſeedlings. Moreover you may
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53203:55"/>graff on a Root or a ſtock Sprung off that Root as in Chap, 1. Sect. 4. &amp; 8. which is near equal to a ſeedling.</p>
                     <p>The ſeed of crabs, or wild Aples. and pears, may be fit to make ſtocks of ſuch Trees deſigned for the fields, or more Rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged grounds; but for a cultivated ſoil I would choice the ſeeds of finer fruits. And ſo the great White-plum is the beſt ſtocks for Apricocks, or for want thereof any other White-plum with great ſhoots, albeit it doth on any plum: but we reject it ſelf for a ſtock, as being too ſpongie and not ſo durable. But Peaches and nectarins, takes only beſt upon Peach ſtocks, ſo cherries on geens, and Plumes upon plumes.</p>
                     <p>Goosberries, and currans, needs not graffing; they do well by Suckers, layers, and cuttings.</p>
                     <p>To make Dwarſe Aples, Graff or bud on the paradiſe or any that hath Burry-knots, Codlings, Redſtracks, &amp;c. Dwarſe Pears on the Quince: but no Pear holds well on it (that I have tryed,) ſave Red Pear Achans and longavil; but you may re-graff for varieties. And if you be very curious for theſe ſtocks (which; I am not) you may cut them at the Spring, when ready for graffing, within 2 Inches of the ground, and at <hi>Auguſt</hi> come twelve moneths Inoculate in that young ſhoot, and perhaps they will prosper the better, but I think graffing in the Roots of Pears, will produce Dwarfs.</p>
                     <p>Dwarfe-cherries on the morella, or on the common Red cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Or on that Red geen ſpoken of in Chap. 3. Sect. 2. which is more Dwarffiſh than the black.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The mellow, warme and light ground is for fruits; and allthough the beſt, warmeſt and lighteſt land, yields moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent corn, yet the ſtrong, ſtiff, cold, moiſt yields not ſo good fruits, plants, Graſs, Hay, &amp;c. Aples affect a pretty rich loamy ſoil, tho they will bear in clay mixt with lym, dung, and Turff.</p>
                     <p>Pears will proſper well enough where the ſoil is mixt with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. But both Aples and Pears are better reliſhed in warme gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unds that are not over moiſt, than in cold and wet: yet there be ſome grounds hath ſwect moiſture, others ſoure; Which laſt is very bad,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53203:55"/>and therefore muſt be helped by draining and application of proper Medicine, ſee Chap. 2.</p>
                     <p>Cherries, Plumes, Apricocks, Peaches affect a light, ſharp ſoil throughly prefared and mixed with Rotted manures. As to their propagation,</p>
                     <p>By Graffing are Aples, Pears, Cherries, Plumes, Quince, Medlar, Wallnut, Cheſnut, Filbeard, Service, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Aple, and Pear ſeed, must be ſeparate from the Fleſhy ſubſtance and ſpread to dry a little eſpecially the Cyder-marie, leſt it heat; you may roll it in Sand to help the ſeparation: keep it in a couch of dry Sand till Winter paſs, then ſow them as ſoon as the froſts are over; they come up that ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>For raiſing Cherries or Greens ſee Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Peach, Plum, and Almond-ſtones muſt be uſed in all caſes as Cherries, only you may break the Peach Stones.</p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53203:56"/>
                     <p>Uſe the Quince-ſeed as Aples. As for the reſt, I have ſhewed how they are increased in the laſt Section, and how to performe the ſeveral wayes in Chap. 1.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt prepare a ſeminary and nurſerie, as before for Forreſt-trees, ſee Chap. 3. Sect. 1. ſow every ſpecies by themselves, keep them clean of weeds, and the next or ſecond year after the ſeeds riſe, if they ſhoot luſtily, (draw out the biggeſt firſt) tranſplant them into the nurſerie in ſingle rowes 2 foot intervall, and half a foot in the rowes, for conveniency in hawing, graffing, pruning, &amp;c. and obſerve to prun Root and ſide-branches in planting, as I directed with Forreſt-trees; only when you have got them to a convenient hight for graffing, you may cut their tops to make their bodies ſwell the ſooner, albeit this be not permitted with Forreſt-trees. However graff and inoculat, while the ſtocks are young, e're they be an Inch Diameter, and they will ſooner heal the wound: let them have a years ſettlement in the nurſerie before you graff; but you may inoculat that ſame inſuing ſummer after planting, eſpecially if they be very free and luſtie. Next year after grassed, remove them to a wider distance, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 foot one way and a foot the other, Prun there Roots at every removal, and enter a pruning, that they may provide for a well ſhapen head, cut them near now while young, if you would have all their branches of an equal greatneſs, and of order proper, as anon. I ſhall inform you.</p>
                     <p>In ſetting your ſtocks in the nurſerie, I preſume you will ſet every kind by themſelves. <hi>i. e.</hi> Pears with Pears, and Aples with Aples, &amp;c. And when you graff or bud, write down in your nurſerie-book their ſpecies as they ſtand, <hi>viz.</hi> begin at the end of ſuch a nurſerie, and ſay the firſt row is graffed, with ſuch a ſort and ſo furth: and if you have more than one in a row, then ſet in a ſtake betwixt each ſpecies, and ſo write thus, from such an end of ſuch a row; to the firſt ſtake is ſo many of ſuch a ſort or ſpecies; thence to the ſecond ſtake ſo many, of another, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When you tranſplant Fruit-Trees into orchards, do, as I directed with Forreſt-trees in groves; plant not deep, neither
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53203:56"/>trench too deep; but tempt the roots by baiting the ſurface with dungs to make them run ebb within the reach of the Sun and ſhoures. Therefore mix the Earth in the holes (which ſhould be 6 or 8 foot diameter) with Rotted neats dung and Earth well turned, ſweetned and Prepared as in Chap: 2. Cover, delve, and haw their bulks as in Chap. 3. Sect. 3. and for further impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and keeping your Fruit-trees in good caſe, ſee Sect. 6. of this Chapter, prune their Roots at every removal, as Forreſt-trees, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience forbids me to make exception of the Peach or any other, as ſome doth) And proportion their heads to their Roots by pruning: but here note, that, as Forreſt-trees arc train'd up high bodies and unlopt heads, so Fruit-trees with low bodies, their heads lopt and branches topt; therefore eaſily proportion'd, as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>Standards of 4 years old, may be planted out of nurſeties into Orchards, Wall-trees of 2 years old.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon of the year is as ſoon as they give over growing; (if the leaves be not off, cut them, ſaving a little tail of their ſtalks) its true you may plant any time in Winter, weather open, but rather let the froſts be over, and the ſpring Approaching, if you have miſſed the fore-end of Winter, which is the better ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>For ſtandards arc Aples, Pears, Cherries, Plumes, Gooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Currans, Barberries, Quince, Wallnut, Cheſnut, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beards, Service: But I think all theſe deſerves not a place in the orchard.</p>
                     <p>For Walls are Apricocks, Peaches, Nectarines, Almond, Vine, Fig, Currans, Aples, Pears, Cherries, Plumes, &amp;c. But you need not take up much with Almond, Vine, Fig, nor Nectarine</p>
                     <p>On the ſouth ſide of the Wall plant Apricocks, Peaches, Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines, Vine, &amp;c. On the east and weſt ſides Cherries, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Aples, Pears, &amp;c On the north ſide Plumes, ſome Pears, as great Bargamor, ſome Aples, Currans eſpecially, and Raſps, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When you elect them in the nurſerie, hang ſticks tyed at them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53203:57"/>figured, and write the ſame figure on the Paper at their name to diſtinguiſh their ſpecies; and afterwards being planted write them, as they ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Begin betimes to prune your Fruit-trees, ſpare them not while young: reduce them into a good ſhape, and order while ſuch; ſo will they not only Soon over-grow the wounds, their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being but ſmall, but alſo when they ſhould come to bear fruit, you ſhall not need to cut ſo much, only purge them of ſuperfluities; and this is the way to make Trees Fruitful as well as pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>Some Ignorants are againſt pruning, ſuffering their Trees to run and Ramble to ſuch a head of confuſion, as neither bears well nor fair: for the Root is not able to maintain ſuch, farr leſs fruit too; and therefore are their fruit ſo ſmall and Imperfect; in the mean time the Tree ſpends its ſtrength, and ſo cannot live long, nor make good ſervice in their time: yea ſomtimes the Root is not ſo much as able to bear ſuch monſtrous heads; I know one windy day proſtrate above half a ſcore ſuch in a little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</p>
                     <p>Others again that are for pruning uſually runs on the other extream, by cutting too much, and untimely; and ſome ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they ſhould cut, and cutting ſuch as they ought to ſpare: but the general errour even amongſt the learned is, that they ſpare them While they ſhould prune, <hi>viz:</hi> the very firſt and ſecond year in ſpecial, yea the firſt 5 or 6 years; and then they fall a maſſackering: at which time the branches being growen ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of them greater than other, who now runs away with all the nouriſhment from the ſmaller; inſomuch that no man can redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce them to order again, having thus neglected the time. Albeit you ſhould endevour it by cutting deep, or exterminating theſe great branches, which I confeſs is the next remeed; but then as theſe wounds brings cankers, hollowneſs, &amp;c. So doth the work retard their bearing fruit. And indeed its about the time that Trees ordinarly begin to bear fruit, that theſe unskilful
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53203:57"/>men begin to prune: and the more they are thus cut in the head, the more they ſpring out to wood, and the leſs fruit they beat. But experience has taught me to begin, While young.</p>
                     <p>And when you do begin conſider on the hight of the body, (for as high Trees are unprofitable, ſo too low Trees in orchards are inconvenient) for Aple and Pear ſtandards two or three foot, plume and cherrie 3 or 4 foot, Dwarff and Wall-trees half a foot; there cut the top that Runs Straight upwards, making it to ſpread out in branches round, ſuffer no branch to aſpire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other in hight, nor any to croſs, Rub, or gall one another; and whatever branch or twig you cut off, cut cloſe and clean by the body or branch (except in the caſe of old Trees and great bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as I obſerved in pruning Forreſt-trees) and in toping of branches cut cloſe and ſmooth Immediatly above a leaf bud, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upwards. And when you prun, ſpare the fruit buds (the full ones are them) except you ſee them too many; then purge by the Knife, likwayes if afterwards you find more fruit knotted than the Tree can be able to nurſe to perfection, thin them in time.</p>
                     <p>But your firſt work is to proportion the head to the Root, by pruning; cut the tops at a convenient hight, that the Tree may grow equally furniſhed round; for cutting as it diminiſheth, ſo it forms and ſhapes the head, inſomuch as it furniſheth with new young ſhoots, that may be train'd, as you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Standards ſhould have but four Arms breaking out for a head, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening equally round, theſe divided into branches, and again ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding into twigs &amp; that you may the better underſtand what to cut, you may ſtand under, go about, look up through the tree where you may eſpy ſuperfluities: keep them clear, void, open within like a bell and level on the the top make ſome larger opens towards the the ſouth for Sun beams entrance; let no branch grow croſs through the heart nor ſhoot ſpring up therein; (minding alwayes to prun ſuch as croſs, Rubs and galls other as above is noted) &amp; any branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſhoots, or twigs that grows not the way you would have them cut them at the place whence you think they will ſend furth ſhoots
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53203:58"/>which may lead the way you deſire them: cut cloſe, ſmooth, and ſlanting at the back of a leaf bud tending that way; by this I bring Trees to order.</p>
                     <p>Wall-Trees eſpecially ſhould be cut near, while young, that they may ſend furth a thicket of ſmall ſhoots for furniſhing your walls from the bottom, equally: and if you continue to top them every year at a convenient hight (perhaps about half a foot above the laſt) that will make them ſhoot all their branches of an equal uniformity of greatneſs, hight, and thickneſs, ſo that no long, bair or naked branch be ſeen there, neither one or two great and all the reſt ſtarved ſmall; the common fault of our wall Trees, and is occaſioned through neglecting to cut while young even the firſt year, as is ſaid above.</p>
                     <p>But albeit a Tree right begun and ſo going on, yet one years ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or wrong pruning may ſpoil it: for as I was once pruning wall Trees, an Ingenious perſon ſtanding by, ſaid I cut them too low, alleadging thereby, the wall ſhould be long uncovered, deſiring me to cut them a little higher: I told him, that was wrong, but for to ſatisfie him I did cut 2 of them about 8 or 9 Inches hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher than I deſigned or ſhould have don. The next year theſe two Trees left about a foot naked round, and above the ſame crown'd like neſts while the reſt was equally and orderly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; when he beheld this, his minde was changed, and I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leidged to cut exactly where I ſhould have don the precedent year: which was now a little below the midle of the naked place, and this did put them ſeveral years behind the reſt of bearing fruit.</p>
                     <p>You may nail them at midſummer that year of planting, and ſo continue to do at the ſeaſons herafter, diſcribed: prepare dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plancher-nails and tags of hats, (which is better than leather) ſhape the tags about half Inch broad, and betwixt 3, 4, and 5 Inches long, making a gaſh with the Knife near the ends by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to put through the nail; then ſpread the Tree, laying, plying, &amp; nailing every individual branch by it ſelf, all at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from other, not cloſe in one place and wide in another,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53203:58"/>and let non croſs other, the ſuperfluous and theſe that will not ply eaſily, and the exuberant or luſtie that Robs the reſt, muſt be cut away.</p>
                     <p>Well plyed Trees will appear like apricocks; train, ſpread, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe on a low wall, which you may cauſe lean all one way, as half of the other: drive the nail but half way in, and on the upperſide of the branch, elſe it will lean and gall; at every nailing alter the old nails and beware of pinching tags, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The time for pruning old planted and hardie Trees, is any time betwixt the leaf falling and the Spring, but let the froſts be over before you prune the new planted young and tender, and before the ſap riſe, otherwayes the froſts will penetrate the wounds and make a ſore: but if you muſt cut before the froſts, becauſe their heads may be obnoxious to the winds, (ſuch are ordinarly the new planted ſtandards) then yow may cut a little, and at Spring cut off theſe pieces left cleanly, as before is noted. Alſo let the froſts be over before you prune your Wall-trees and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bud; only I uſe to let peaches bud furth a little e're I prune them, otherwayes pieces of their branches ſomtimes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh after the Knife.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, that you muſt Rub off all unneceſſary buds, and pull up ſuckers and weeds from the Roots, you muſt alſo give all your Trees a midſummer pruning, (which is ordinarly the end of <hi>June</hi> &amp; beginning of <hi>July</hi>) a good time to cut any ſhoots of this year; any ſhoots or buds as tend not only to the deforming your Trees, but Robs them of that ſap, which may be otherwayes ſpent in nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Tree and its fruits, (but the ſpring is the time of croping or cutting their tops untill the wall be covered, then crop at both ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) thin &amp; purge gently to let in the Sun, but not to ſcorch the fruit, this is alſo the time of furniſhing your Trees with pedaſtools or Bearers: therefore in repruning, ſave as many of the likelyeſt ſhoots, as ar well placed, and cut them at the 3d or 4th bud froml the Tree; but cut quit off the luſtieſt and greateſt of this years (whicn Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants do ſpare) &amp; nail up ſuch as are for filling up the defects of the wall.</p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53203:59"/>
                     <p>You may go through them in harveſt and purge the fruit of ſuperfluous leaves which hinders the Sun: but do it ſo, as there may be leaves ſufficient to ſcreen the fruit, and cut quit off the luſtie ſhoots of this ſecond Spring, that Robbs the Tree and fruit.</p>
                     <p>As for goosberrie and curran ſtandards, train them to a foot ſtem with a handſome round but thin head: theſe at Walls half a foot ſtem with a well ſpread head ſupported with Rodes layed croſs, faſtned with nails and tags. Raſps may be in ſhadowy bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures or beds a foot diſtance, kept clean of Suckers, weeds , and dead wood.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſome years in ſome places we have ripe Grapes, eſpecially that we have under the name of Frontinak: therefore if you think a Tree or two of them worth your while, plant them at a ſouth Wall in a pure and fine mould, not wet, ſour, and croud, but a light ſweet ſoil mixt with ſome Cowes dung Rotted in heaps with the mould. Plant ebb and trench not deep; prune them every year, prune low in <hi>February,</hi> and at the true mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer. Cut off the luſtie young ſhoots and tendralls with ſheers betwixt the 2d and 3d Joynt above the fruit; and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> purge it of ſuperfluous leaves, but reſerve ſo many as may ſcreen the fruit a little.</p>
                     <p>There be ſome ſorts of Fruit-Trees that will blow and bear themſelves to death, when young or midle aged: For ſuch out moſt of the blowing buds, and thin the head to make it ſhoot again.</p>
                     <p>I got ſome cherries and other ſtone fruit from Holland, who rooke this decay: wherefore in the Spring I did cut off the blowing buds, and the branches near the place where the Tree headed, reſerving only ſome buds for receiving the ſap; (in caſe they ſhould have put furth at the midle of the body or a little above ground) this made them ſhoot to wood. Therefore I conclude that by this and delving about, you may help ill-thriving Trees.</p>
                     <p>There be alſo ſome Aples and Pears, that will be full of falſe bearing buds, that doth not blow, ſuch having got more head
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53203:59"/>the Roots can well maintain, conſequently has not ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſpare ſap for bloſſoms, farr leſs for fruit, which by pruning and thinning the head, and by ſlitting the bark of the body in the Spring, may be made afterwards to bear well, when they have put furth new ſhoots at the head.</p>
                     <p>Some Trees there be that will not bear of themſelves till they be old: but if you cut off the head of the ſhoots as ſoon as ever the Spring ſhoot is over (which is at the true midſummer) and take out ſome great boughs then, if you minde your time, and do it with diſcretion, you may force that Tree to put furth blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing buds, and blow and bear the year following, as I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you in next ſect: but,</p>
                     <p n="6">6. One main buſineſs is to incloſe your plantations: avoid plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too deep, too dry, too cold, too moiſt, and guard your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards from winds by planting two rowes of Forreſt-trees, at leaſt round without the Wall, the breadth of a large walk therefrom with Thickets of the ſame on the Weſt, North and Eaſt, but eſpecially on the Weſt. (Yet mind regularity) alſo obſerve my methode of planting, and pruning and ordering their bulks of 6 or 8 foot Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter: but when the Tree growes old and their feeding Roots farr abroad, you cannot reach to feed them with dungs in this narrow Compaſs; therefore enlarg it, or otherwayes confine them a little ſooner and hinder their too farr gauding, by digging a Circle round the Tree perhaps 8 foot Diameter, and cut all the Roots clean off there, that hath run out, applying freſh and ſweet Mould, ſo ſhall they emitt Fibres or feeding Roots in thicket, which may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with refreſhments once in two or three years, as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. And this cutting the Roots will cauſe Trees, that are apt to ſpend more in wood than Fruit, alter there-from, (add this to the latter-end of the laſt Section) and the ends of the Roots cut off, and their buttends raiſed up a little, will ſerve as flocks to Graff upon.</p>
                     <p>When you would enrich your worne out plantations, if the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und be poor and dry, add well rotten dung prepared and mixt with ſoil. The Water that ſoaks from a Dung-hill is excellent: for it will
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53203:60"/>follow the Roots and Enrich the Trees. If the ground be cold and moiſt, add Pigeons dung or Aſhes and ſoot; which is alſo excellent if it be leopared with unskilfull dunging, or by noyſome weeds that grows about ſuch Roots, (where the owner is a ſluggard) &amp; hatches or neſts, moles, mice, toads, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If you obſerve the premiſes, you may prevent their diſeaſes, ſuch as ill thriving, &amp;c. But if you have, or do neglect, and the diſeaſes be come, as if Cankers or Galls be entered, cut them clean out, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wound with a Plaiſter of Cowes dung and clay compound; if the bark be pilled by hares, conies or mice, apply a Plaiſter of the ſame; (but better prevent the laſt three, by ſwadling the Trees with Straw or Hay ropes, unlooſed in ſummer and renewed every Winter, if your fence cannot Guard them.) Ill taken off branches, broken or rotten branches muſt be cut off clean and ſmooth. If any Trees be bark-bound, (which is the miſery of many and eſpecially Forreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees) ſlit them in die Spring through the bark on both ſides with a ſharp Knife from the head to the Root, and delve about them, otherwayes raiſe and plant ebber if too deep; which is the common cauſe of this diſeaſe together with bad incloſure.</p>
                     <p>If Jaundiſe, cut off the diſeaſed wood; if moſs, ſcrape or ſinge it off: but its vain to attempt the cure untill you firſt remove the cauſe; which you will find to proceed from ſome malignity at the Roots, whither the diſeaſe be Bark-binding, Cankers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And this moſt commonly by ill-planting, (and not incloſing) as among Clay, Water, impenitrable Gravel, &amp;c. Water muſt be draineds, it an intollerable evil. Cold clayes, ſtiff and hard ſoil muſt be trenched and mixed with dungs and ſoils, often ſtirred and fallowed, as above is directed. And if you would have Trees to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, obſerve their nature, and wherein they moſt delight; and ſo apply and help them accordingly.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53203:61"/>day or two in the Sun, impregnate with pigeons dung, but let it be freſh and clean, conveying it to the Roots, not touching their leaves with it: if they be ſowen on the laſt diſcribed hotbed <hi>viz.</hi> in caſes, ſow at a wider diſtance, and you need not tranſplant, but renew the heat when needful, and as they grow larger, cover with the Bell-Glaſſes, giving them Air by hoiſing the Glaſſes, till they can endure the Sun without them, but dill cover all cloſe at night again: when they have put out runners 4 or 5 Inches long, cut off one or two joynts at the end, and when they have gathered more ſtrength, cut off all but the prime ſhoots. And when the Fruit knots, nip off that runner above the Fruit between the 2d and 3d joynt, cutting ſtill off the new ones that ſpring, but do not expoſe the Fruit to the Sun: lay tile under the Fruit: wipe the Dew off the Glaſſes and plants eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning, but keep the Glaſſes on the Fruit, and Water non now.</p>
                     <p>Cucumbers may be ordered that ſame Very way, and ſo may Pompions, but they are not ſo tender, I have raiſed them without Glaſſes.</p>
                     <p>Strawberries are a very fine and delicat Fruit, and are eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, but beſt by the ſmall Plants at the ſtrings when taken Root at the joynts: plant them at any or both ſprings, but I find moſt of fibrous Rooted plants apt to be ſpued out of ground by Winter, if not Rooted ſufficiently before. Dung, delve, mix and prepare a light and warme ſoil, prun their Root and top, and plant in ſtreight lines 5 rowes in the bed, and ſuffer them never to over-run, but keep each ſtock by themſelves, ſtill taking off all their ſtrings, (except at ſometime you permit a few for increaſs) weed and haw among them; and in <hi>September</hi> cut them within 2 Inches of the ground, and lay Cow dung over the bed (reſerving their tops free) covered with a ſtrinkling of Sand; this will much improve them. So as they will not need renewing for 6 or 7 years.</p>
                     <p>Artichoks is a fine and tailing Fruit, and is increaſed by offſets chiefly, planted in the ſpring, a fat and well cultured ſoil, light and warme, enriched with Sheeps dung, plant in ſtraight lines, about 3 foot diſtance having prun'd their Roots, and cut their tops within
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53203:61"/>half a foot; Water (if needfull) with qualified Water, and ſtill cut away their under and hanging leaves, and haw the weeds as they begin to peep: when their Fruit is ſpent, cut them within half a foot of the ground, and delve and cover the plot over with dung and leitter, keeping their tops free, and in <hi>Aprile</hi> delve down the ſame, and extirpate them of Suckers, ſliping them off carefully lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 2 or 3 at moſt to each ſtock forbearing; And they will flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh near 9 or 10 years.</p>
                     <p>Great beans muſt be planted early in the Spring, as ſoon as the great froſts or over, in deep rich ground, 2 foot Intervall and half a foot in their rows; theſe for ſeed when full ripe, cut and bind in little ſheaves and lay on Trees to dry</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Weeding (I think) may be accompted the moſt material part of Gard'nery: The learned <hi>Evelin</hi> takes notice of it; his directions are, weed and haw betimes, continue weeding befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they run to ſeed, which is of extraordinary Importance both
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53203:65"/>for ſaving of charge, Improvement of fruit, and the neat main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the gardens: wherefore ſayes he, keep your weeds doun, that they grow not to ſeed, and begin your work of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing as ſoon as they begin allmoſt to peep; by this means you will diſpatch more in a few houres than afterwards in a whole day; whereas if you neglect it till they are ready to ſeed, you do but ſtir and repair the Earth for a more numerous crop, and your ground ſhall never be cleared.</p>
                     <p>And this agrees with what I had written my ſelf, <hi>viz:</hi> deſtroy weeds while young: for when they have growen ſtrong and got deep Rooting, they'le not only take the nuriſhment from the good plant, but there will be ſuch difficulty in grubing them out, that the good ſeed or plant is in danger of being deſtroyed; but if you ſuffer them to bear and ſow their ſeeds, then (beſides that they exhauſt much more of the ſubſtance of the ground) you ſhall find the work Intollerable, for they'le poiſon the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le ground, inſomuch that one years ſeeds will coſt many years weeding: and therefore prevent theſe things by keeping doun the weeds; ſo ſhall your work become eaſie and gardens handſome.</p>
                     <p>In beds where hawes cannot go, you muſt weed with your hands on both ſides, ſitting in the furrow on a ſtraw cuſhion, pull up the Root cleanly, taking the help of the weeding Iron where needful: but make uſe of the haw in all the Intervalls, drill-beds, nurſeries, furrowes, tables, or pathes, whereby one will clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe more than ſome ſix by weeding with their hands; and if dry weather, they'le wither where they ly cut, otherwayes Rake them in heaps and ſpread again when Rotted, or carry them to ſome open trench or pit, and ſtill be viſiting your plantations, that as ſoon as you perceive a weed peep, you may chalk it.</p>

I do not approve of planting the clod with them brought out of the fields, for it rotts and turns ſour, and ſo kills the plant, (albeit you may keep the clod about it till you come home but,) then part it off carefully, prun their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres a little, make the holes with the Trowall, and plant in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Earth, to that of their wonted abode, well ſtirred and aired, which is ane excellent mean that makes all plants proſper, and therefore diligently to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of Shrubs that loſe their leaves in Winter, the choiceſt whereof are,</p>
                     <p>Roſes of many ſorts, they are increaſed by Suckers and layers. the muſk may be buded on the Eglantin and ſet at a Wall; the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Yellow bears faireſt Flowers, if you bud the ſingle Yellow on a Frankfort, and rebud the double Yellow thereon, (I have done it immediatly on the ſingle) planted as a Standard, a little ſhaded in Summer, and kept clean of Suckers and ſuperfluous buds; and any that blow hot freely may be ſlit at the 5 diviſions of the hoſe.</p>
                     <p>Prune your Roſes after the Flower is paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> before the full Moon in <hi>October,</hi> cut behind a leaf-bud and cleanſe them of dead wood, and if you deſire fair Flowers, ſufter but one Stem on a Root and keep it low, and every 5th year, cut them down to the ground, renewing their earth with old Cow dung.</p>
                     <p>Jaſmines. Honiſuckles, Pipe-trees, &amp;c. by ſuckers, layers and cuttings. See Chap. 1.</p>
                     <p>Mezerion by ſeed, as Hawthorn; they ly as long.</p>
                     <p>Of Shrubs that be ever green there is Box, Savin, Arbor vitae, Tameriſk, Privite, &amp;c. by ſuckers, layers, and cuttings in <hi>Aprile;</hi> a ſhade and moiſt fat ſoil till Rooted.</p>
                     <p>The Cherrie-bay is an excellent Green, and not very Apt to blaſt, there is alſo Lauruſtinus, Philyrea, Alaternus, (I love not Pyracantha,) Juniper, (I care not for ever green Oak and Cypreſs) all by ſeeds, which muſt be couched in Sand before Winter, and ſowen in <hi>Aprile,</hi> to riſe that ſeaſon except the Juniper, which lyes till

See where I have ſpoken of Holly, for the ſame Rules may be obſerved for theſe to be ſpread on Walls, but ſave the top of Standards: they do all well by ſuckers and layers alſo, except Cypreſs and Juniper. Be carefull to defend your ſeedling Greens while young, from ſpring blaſtings; yet do not choak them for want of good Air.</p>
                     <p>The Pin, Cypreſs, and ever-green Oak, (the laſt in ſpecial) will ſcarce endure a removal from ſeminary, therefore ſow them in drills 2 foot intervall one way, and half a foot the other; and the next year after they riſe, make a ſpade-bit trench between the rowes, and work in cautiouſly, till you diſcover the running down Root at one ſide, which you muſt top with the pruning Knite, and level in the Earth as it was, cut off ſome ſide-boughes and thin the head: let them remain two years; then remove and plant them, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                     <p>Greens that are beſt worthy our eſteem, are <hi>Scots</hi> firr Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, Holly for Hedges, the Cherrie-bay for Walls, or barren creeping jvy, which will neither blaſt nor ſeek ſupporting.</p>

For my part I rather be in the Woods, Parks, Orchards, Kitchen Garden or fields meaſuring, planting, and improving the ground to beſt advantage.

                     <p n="3">3. Of Fibrous Rooted Flowers.</p>
                     <p>July-flowers are the beſt, and are increaſed by offſets, layers, ſlips, and ſeeds. A light loamy Earth well mixt with rotted ſoil of Cowes and Sheep, a year before hand.</p>
                     <p>Albeit I have raiſed many double by ſeed of my own reaping; yet the ſureſt way to preſerve the beſt, is by laying, becauſe ſeedlings are apt to dy after they have born a Flower: how to lay ſee Chap. 1. Sect. 6. Plant out your layers at ſpring, and give theſe in Potts freſh Earth as the Orenge-tree, and yearly cleanſe the old Roots of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, dead, and Rotten leaves, and leave not above 3 or 4 Spindles for Flower, (if choice) and nip off ſuperfluous buds leſt they blow and bear themſelves to death: and if any bruſt ſlit, as I directed with double Yelow Roſe. At midſummer ſhade from afternoons Sun a little theſe that blow, ſupport them againſt winds, ſet hoofs amongſt them for catching erwigs their enemies; Water well in drought, ſparing their leaves, preſerve the Choice from too much Raines by laying the Pots on their ſides, ſtrick off the Snow when it lyes too weightie on them, theſe you will not to beat ſeed, cut their ſtalks as ſoon as paſt the Flower.</p>
                     <p>Stock July-flowers by ſeeds or cuttings; the ſeed of ſingle will produce double, but the more leaves the Mother hath, the doubler ſhall the product be; ſow and plant with carnations or July-flowers, they affect a ſoil with them.</p>
                     <p>Prim-roſes, Couſlips, and bears-ears by offſets in the ſpring, o when the Flower is paſt, <hi>(viz. July)</hi> they affect a good natural
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53203:67"/>Earth well mixt with rotten Neats dung: the finer ſorts loves a little ſhade in ſummer, if in Pots or caſes you may tranſport them to ſuch at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Great varieties may be raiſed from ſeed ſowen in Pots, the ſoil aforeſaid mixt with willow Earth in <hi>October,</hi> take head of deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring bairs ears, ſow them as purſlain: ſet the Potts and caſes with them at the Southſide of a Wall till <hi>Aprile,</hi> at which time they ſpring, and muſt be now retired a little as is ſaid; tranſplant in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to Flower next ſpring, and neglect not to Earth up ſuch as are apt to work out of ground namely bears ears.</p>

                     <p>Anemonies the ſame very way as Tulips, except that they require a rich earth mixt with Rotten dung ſo that it be not Rank.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS neceſſarly depends upon the 5th and 6th Chapters, of Fruits and Herbes eatable.</p>
                  <p>Gather Aples and Pears when full ripe, eſpecially theſe for keeping, or for Cyder in a dry day, clear but not froſtie, in large Baſkets lin'd with Straw Matts, upon the 3 footed or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding leathers: at leaſt lay Straw under, if you ſhake them, and ſuffer not too many at once thereon.</p>
                  <p>Gather Apricocks, Peaches, Plumes, Cherries, with your hands into clean Baſkets, when full ripe, whither for eating Green, preſerving in Sugar, &amp;c. drying, or for Vines; as alſo currans, Barberries, Raſberries, Gooſberries. The Cucumbers for pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling muſt be ſmall <hi>i. e.</hi> e're their ſeeds grow firme; as Goosberries for baking, boyling, ſauces.</p>
                  <p>Artichocks e're they grow too hard, let theſe for pickling be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt. Let the purſlain for pickling be hard and old, lay it a day or two in the Sun to mortifie. That which you eat Green muſt be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Eat Beans and Peas Green, but do not ſlice down the Beans, nor break the Peas ſtalks, elſe them left thereon cannot fill. You may out off the Beans with a Knife; and for the Peas, hold with the one hand and pull with the other.</p>
                  <p>Aſparagus when tender <hi>i. e.</hi> about 3, 4, or 5 Inches high.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53203:69"/>Lettice when young, but its beſt Cabbaged. Succory, Endive, Sellery Blanched. Creſſes, Parſly, Chervil, Burnet, when young and tender. Sorrall, Spinag, beets before they ſhoot for ſeed. And ſo is Arage, Marygold, Bugloſs, Burrag. Shallot and onions when their ſtalks withered, tho ſhibols are eaten green. Leeks any time before they ſhoot to ſeed. Coleflowers when firme and white e're they ſpoil; And ſo cabbage when hard. Sweet herbes any time either green or dryed, but gather them in their prime for drying.</p>
                  <p>Liquoriſh no diſh but drink. ſee Chap. 6. Sect. 4. where you will alſo find ſeaſon of Scorzonera, Beetrave, Carrot, Turneep, Skirret, Parſneep, Potatoes, &amp;c.</p>

Beſides what is ſaid above of planting and ſowing at Spring, ſummer, and harveſt for ſomes longer continuance, as alſo of raiſing ſome earlyer than naturally, by means of hotbeds, and what I might ſay of retarding others by tranſplantations, &amp;c. There be wayes of preſerving them out of the garden, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Aples and Pears may be carryed into the conſervatory or ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehouſe in the large baskets between two men; which muſt be a cloſe but cleanly and wholſome Room floored, lyned, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with boards and ſhelves of the ſame round: let them ſweat a little on the floor with clean oat ſtraw under them; then dry and lay them Aple-thick on the ſhelves, opening the north win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ill fair, clear, windy dayes, eſpecially at firſt that it may dry up the ſuperfluous moiſture. turne them ſomtimes, and in froſts cover them with matts, and ſhut cloſe the houſe: ſome of the choice you may wrap in dry papers ſingly, and often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that you may remove any that begin to rott: for they quickly affect the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The way of preſerving Cherries, Plumes, &amp;c. In Wine, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Hony, or ſugar is eaſie, as alſo of drying them in the oven.</p>
                  <p>And you may pickle barberries in Vinegar, and ſalt well dryed, and ſugar: to each pound and a half fruit, a pound of ſalt cold
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53203:69"/>again, ¼ pound ſugar beat to powder; put them by layings in a well glazed Earth pot, and when they have ſtood a whole week well ſtopt powr in a mutchken Vinegar to each pound fruit; if you find the ſawces too ſharp put as much ſugar as ſalt.</p>
                  <p>Range cucumbers the ſame way, and ſtrew ſalt, and Vinegar till they be all covered, and you may add a little dill and ſweet bay leaves for odour, and cover them cloſe 40 dayes unbroken: then pare when you ſerve them up.</p>
                  <p>For Artichocks diſſolve two large handfuls of great Salt (that is dryed on the fire in a pan) in one mutchken Vinegar and three of fair water, mix them while the Salt is yet hot, (but put not the liquor on the fire) boyl the Artichocks till the leaves come off eaſily, and while the cleanſed ſtools are yet warme, you may have 3 nutmegs, 3 drop cloves, 1½ dram mace, ¼ ounce white pepper, ½ ounce cinamon, beat to fine powder and ſtrew upon them; then pack them in the pot with five or ſix ſpoonfuls the liquor on each ſtratum: when all potted poure on the reſt of the pickle, and ſtop cloſe.</p>
                  <p>To pickle them green put to every pound of cleanſed ſtools an ounce Salt dryed and ¼ ounce ſpices laſt nam'd mixt in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and having dawbed the ſtools full of holes, throw the powder thereon, when the pot is full, melt as much butter as cover them over two Inches, and when cold, cover cloſe with leather.</p>
                  <p>To pickle Beet-raves, boyl and put them in glazed pots, with whole pepper and as much Vinegar as cover all over, ſtoping them cloſe.</p>
                  <p>Aſparagus may be parboyled and pickled as Artichocks: and ſo may green peas with cods.</p>
                  <p>Purſlain as Cucumbers: and ſo may taragon, ſampeir, broom-buds, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Put marygold flowers in paper bags near the chimney till they paſs hazard of mouldineſs; do juſt ſo with true ſaffron. But becauſe ſew knows how to order it, obſerve, to part its off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets and plant with other bulbs at half foot diſtance in the beds or bordurs, it flowers in <hi>Septem:</hi> then be careful to go through in the mornings and gather the ſaffron <hi>viz:</hi> the thrums that are in the midle of the flowers, it bears not well till the 3d, 4th and 5th year; then you muſt remove it. But to the matter in hand.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Of diſhes, as of Aples you may have baked without any ingredients ſave ſugar, Roſted alone, and ſo boyled, fryed by ſhavers, with a little freſh butter, ſtew'd betwixt two plates, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cleaved and taken out their cors, add a little ſweet butter and ſugar. Of Pears you may have Roſted and boyled as Aples, alſo ſtoved being cut in fower and put dry in a ſtoup or even of white Iron; and ſo ſet in the pot among water to boyl, you may have both Aples and Pears green with cheife.</p>
                  <p>Cherries are excellent baked, and ſo goosberries. Apricocks, Peaches, Plumes, Cherries, Currans, Goosberries, Rasber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are all excellent diſhes green, or conſerved. Strawberries and Red wine, or ſweet cream.</p>
                  <p>Cucumbers pickled for ſallad to roſted mutton: or if ripe, ſlice and lay them an hour in Salt, and ſo powr off their water. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichocks are either pickled or freſh, boyled and eaten with ſweet beaten butter.</p>
                  <p>Beans and peas boyled with ſavory and thym fagot, ſerved up with ſweet butter beat amongſt them, and ſet a little on a coal or chaffing.</p>

                  <p>Purſlain may be eaten green with ſugar and Vineger, or Oyl, ſtew'd with meat, beſides the pickled.</p>
                  <p>Lettice green as purſlain; and ſo creſſes, Chervil, Burnet, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage flowers, and wood ſorrall.</p>
                  <p>Spinag is excellent floves being boyled with lamb or Veall with a little ſorrall therein, as alſo choped diſhes thereof with butter.</p>
                  <p>The ſame way uſe beets; alſo make green broth of them with leeks, fagot of thyme and parſly. In ſome ſtoves and broths you may put Arag, Marigold leaves, Violet leaves, Straw-berrie leaves, Bugloſs, Burrage, and Endive. In Pottage put Iuice of ſorrall, fagot of thime and parlſly, and in moſt of broths.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Of drinks, as of Aples to make cyder: I cannot name our cyder Aples, for I uſe to mix all the ripe at once in the orchard, that is of a fine Juice and eaſie to ſeparat from the fleſh, and pears that have plenty of Juice and hard fleſh though harſh.</p>
                  <p>In France they extoll the Rennet cyder, in England the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Redſtrake. (Which in France they ſet at naught) they ſpeak of genetmoil and muſts, ſome pipens and parmains. And for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the bromsbury, and Ruddy horſe pear. All which and many more <hi>Hugh Wood</hi> Gard'ner at Hamiltone has to ſel. But now the different ſoils begets alterations in fruits beſides the climate; yet both defects may be a little helped: The firſt by uſing all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to prepare the ground throughly, as is directed in Chap. 2. Fallowing is a moſt commendable eſſay.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond by graffing and regraffing upon early: good fence and ſhelter round the ground are very conducible.</p>
                  <p>To make this excellent Wine, provide trough and beatters, preſs and harbag, lagallon and tappering fat, barrels and hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheads; (for even by the common ſcrew preſs I have made a hogſhead cyder in a day) be ſure your veſſells be ſweet, elſe you ſpoil all; white Wine, Sack-caſk or ſuch, as keept cyder before. I have heard of cyder-caſk 3 Inches thick in the ſtaves, which I believe is of great Advantage in preſerving the liquor: but if any be tainted, put a little unſtaked Lyme Stone, and a little water in the Barrell, and ſtop it cloſe; when ſtood a little while and jumbled, pour out and waſh clean, that will cure.</p>
                  <p>The fruit being gathered ripe, as before, let them ly ten or twelve days, if ſummer fruit; and near the double of that time, if winter ſorts: (but the late ripe that gets froſts is not good
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53203:71"/>cyder) mix not with unripe ones, neither ſuffer leaves nor ſtalks among them. When they are ſmall beat, put them in the harbag within the preſs far, and ſo ſcrew them hard again and again; and emptie it thereof and put in more, and do as before: and empty the receiver into the tappering fat, and therein cover it cloſe with a canvaſs till the morrow at that time, before you tun it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the groſs lee may fall to the bottom, then draw it off at a tap three Inches from the bottom, leaving that dreg behind. (The which may go among the preſſings for water cyder) the clearer you tun it into the barrels, the leſs it ferments, and that's beſt cyder: for often cyder ſpends its ſtrength to free it ſelf of the groſſer parts; therefore while your cyder ferments, leave the vent pin looſe, but keep cloſe the bung for preſerving the prodigall waſt of its ſpirit; and as ſoon as the working begin to allay, drive the vent pin dead to: and this will be perhaps in a fortnight, if it begins to work Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, ſome times not till the Spring. But keep faſt the pin till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to work, and that you mind to bottle of it, do as ſoon as fully clear and fine; which is ordinarly at Spring. Put a plum great of fine white loaf ſugar in each bottle, and above all, make your corks faſt and cloſe; then ſet them in the celler amongſt ſand.</p>
                  <p>To make the water cyder put 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The making of Perry differs not from that of cyder.</p>
                  <p>To make Cherrie Wine, to every pound ripe fruit ſtampt, put a Chopin Spring-water and ¼ pound fin white ſugar, boyl the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſugar, ſcum it and put in the juice of your Cherries, let it boyl up again, take it off the fire, run it through a hair-ſive and when its throughly cold, put it in a ſtone pot, and after 6 or 7 dayes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53203:72"/>draw it into bottles, putting a bit loaf ſugar in each, in a quarter year you may fall a drinking, it will keep a year; if you would have it ſtronger, then uſe no more water than ſugar.</p>
                  <p>After the ſawe manner you may make wine of Raſps, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Goosberries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or</p>
                  <p>Take currans very ripe, bruiſe and ſtrain them, and to every pint of the Iuice put a pound and ¼ ſugar into a ſtone or earthen pot, ſcum it often, and at a weeks end draw it off, and take out the ſetlings and put in the liquor again; do this till it be fine, then bottle it; and at a weeks end if it be not fine in the bottles, ſhift it into other bottles.</p>
                  <p>Gather your Goosberries e're they be too ripe, and for every three pound ſtampt fruit, a chopin of water and a pound ſugar: ſteep them 24 houres, then ſtrain them, put the liquor into a a veſſel cloſe ſtopt a fortnight or three weeks, then draw it off if you find it fine, otherwayes ſuffer it longer; and if not fine yet rak it.</p>
                  <p>Its uſuall to make it thus unboyl'd, becauſe it contracts a broun colour in boyling.</p>
                  <p>To every pint Raſps a pound ſugar, let them ſtand two dayes in an earthen pot, often ſtirring and bruiſing them; then put them in a woollen bag to hang up 24 houres and more till the liquor drop out into a ſtone pot, ſuffer it there till fermented and ſcum'd, and at a weeks end (or ſooner if fine) bottle it, and at another weeks end ſhift it into freſh bottles, that you may leave the ſetlings behind: thus ſhift them ſo long as you ſee any ſettlement, the which you may put in a bottle by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Of ſome ſorts of Plumes, as damaſons, &amp;c. may be made wine.</p>
                  <p>That called Cherrie brandie, is a bottle half full of geens, fill'd up with brandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, ſometimes Jumbled a little; and in a moneths time is fit for drinking. Or if you put the like quantity of Goosber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries inſtead of Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ries; that will make the brandie very Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <p>Cherries beſt for wine are blackheart, morella. I think the

                  <p>Of Gooſberries the great Chryſtal, and of currans the great Dutch red, alſo the red Raſp.</p>
                  <p>To have Ail of Liquoriſh, ſlice it very ſmall and pour Water on it when at the boyl: there cover it cloſe till the morrow, powr off this wort, and on more hot-water, to ſtand as long to ſearch it throughly, add your worts together and boyl with a little dry Wormwood <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> but the greateſt difficulty is to barme it when cold, as wort of malt; yet the ſtronger you make it, the eaſier it will take, or if you have the conveniency of ſettlings of good wort of malt to boyl with it; that will facilitate the work.</p>
                  <p>To have good metheglin, take one part of clarified Hony and eight parts of pure Water and boyl well together in a Copper veſſel till the conſumption of the half: but while it boyls take off the ſcum, and when done boyling and beginnes to cool, tun it up, and it will work of it ſelf; as ſoon as done working, ſtop it very cloſe. Some adviſes to bury it under ground three moneths, and that to make if loſe both ſmell and taſt of Hony and Wax, and taſt very like Wine. I uſe to add dry Roſmary and ſweet Marjorum in boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſome barms it as Ail; which I have practiſed effectually.</p>
